["Science and its origin Science is a systematic understanding of natural phenomena in detail so that it can be predicted, controlled and modified . Science involves exploring, experimenting and speculating phenomena happening around us. o The word Science is derived from a latin verb Scientia meaning ‘to know’. o Scientific method is a way to gain knowledge in a systematic and in-depth way. It involves: o Systematic observations o Controlled experiments o Qualitative and Quantitative reasoning o Mathematical modeling o Prediction and verification (or falsification) of theories o Speculation or Prediction o Science does not have any final theory. The improved observations, accurate tools keep improving the knowledge and perspective. Johannes Kepler used Tycho Brahe’s research o n planetary motion to improve Nicolas Copernicus theory. o Quantum mechanics was developed to deal with atomic and nuclear phenomena. Work of Ernest Rutherford on nuclear model of atom became basis of quantum theory given by Niels Bohr. Antiparticle theory of Paul Dirac led to the discovery of antielectron (positron) by Carl Anderson. Natural Sciences Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on observational and empirical evidence. It consists of following disciplines: o Physics o Chemistry o Biology Physics Physics is a study of basic laws of nature and their manifestation in different natural phenomena. Physics is the study of physical world and matter and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. o Word Physics is derived from a Greek word phusikḗ meaning nature. o Two principal types of approaches in Physics are: 1. Unification : This approach considers all of the world’s phenomena as a collection of universal laws in different domains and conditions. Example, law of gravitation applies both to a falling apple from a tree as well as motion of planets around the sun. Electromagnetism laws govern all electric and magnetic phenomena. 2. Reduction : This approach is to derive properties of complex systems from the properties and interaction of its constituent parts. Example, temperature studied under thermodynamics is also related to average kinetic energy of molecules in a system (kinetic theory). Impact and uses of Physics: o It can explain a phenomena happening over a large magnitude with a simple theory. o Experiments and observations are used to develop new theories for unidentified phenomena and improve old theories for existing phenomena. o Development of devices using laws of physics. Chapter 1 Physical World 1 ","Scope of Physics Scope of Physics is vast as it covers quantities with length magnitude as high as 10 40 m or more (astronomical studies of universe) and as low as 10 -14 m or less (study of electrons, protons etc). Similarly the range of time scale goes from 10 -22 s to 10 18 s and mass from 10 -30 kg to 10 55 kg. Physics is broadly divided into two types based on its scope - Classical Physics and Modern Physics . Classical physics deal with the macroscopic phenomena while the modern physics deals with the microscopic phenomena . Macroscopic Domain Macroscopic domain includes phenomena at large scales like laboratory, terrestrial and astronomical. It includes following subjects: 1. Mechanics – It is based on Newton’s laws on motion and the laws of gravitation. It is concerned with motion/equilibrium of particles, rigid and deformable bodies and general system of particles. Examples, a. Propulsion of rocket by ejecting gases b. Water/Sound waves c. Equilibrium of bent rod under a load 2. Electrodynamics – It deals with electric and magnetic phenomena associated with charged and magnetic bodies. Examples, a. motion of a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field b. the response of a circuit to an ac voltage (signal) c. the propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere 3. Optics – It deals with phenomena involving light. Examples, a. Reflection and refraction of light b. Dispersion of light through a prism c. Colour exhibited by thin films 4. Thermodynamics – It deals with systems in macroscopic equilibrium and changes in internal energy, temperature, entropy etc. of systems under application of external force or heat. Examples, a. Efficiency of heat engines b. Direction of physical and chemical process Microscopic Domain Microscopic domain includes phenomena at minuscule scales like atomic, molecular and nuclear. It also deals with interaction of probes like electrons, photons and other elementary particles. Quantum theory has been developed to handle these phenomena. Factors responsible for progress of Physics o Quantitative analysis along with qualitative analysis. o Application of universal laws in different contexts. o Approximation approach (complex phenomena broken down into collection of basic laws). o Extracting and focusing on essential features of a phenomenon. 2 ","Hypothesis, Axiom and Models a) Hypothesis is a supposition without assuming that it is true. It may not be proved but can be verified through a series of experiments. b) Axiom is a self-evident truth that it is accepted without controversy or question. c) Model is a theory proposed to explain observed phenomena. d) Assumption is the basis of physics, where a number of phenomena can be explained. These assumptions are made from experiments, observation and a lot of statistical data. Technological applications of Physics Several examples where Physics and its concepts have led to discoveries/inventions are listed below. o Steam engine was developed from the industrial revolution in eighteenth century. o Wireless communication was developed after discovery of laws of electricity and magnetism. o Neuron-induced fission of uranium, done by Hahn and Meitner in 1938, led to the formation of nuclear power reactors and nuclear weapons. o Conversion of solar, wind, geothermal etc. energy into electricity. Fundamental Forces in nature The forces which we see in our day to day life like muscular, friction, forces due to compression and elongation of springs and strings, fluid and gas pressure, electric, magnetic, interatomic and intermolecular forces are derived forces as their originations are due to a few fundamental forces in nature. A few fundamental forces are: 1. Gravitational Force : It is the force of mutual attraction between any two objects by virtue of their masses. It is a universal force as every object experiences this force due to every other object in the universe. 2. Electromagnetic Force : It is the force between charged particles . Charges at rest have electric attraction (between unlike charges) and repulsion (between like charges). Charges in motion produce magnetic force. Together they are called Electromagnetic Force. 3 ","3. Strong Nuclear Force : It is the attractive force between protons and neutrons in a nucleus.It is charge-independent and acts equally between a proton and a proton, a neutron and a neutron, and a proton and a neutron. Recent discoveries show that protons and neutrons are built of elementary particles, quarks . 4. Weak Nuclear Force: This force appears only in certain nuclear processes such as the β -decay of a nucleus . In β -decay, the nucleus emits an electron and an uncharged particle called neutrino .This particle was first predicted by Wolfgang Pauli in 1931. Below table shows difference between the above forces. Name Relative Strength Range Operates among Gravitational force 10 – 39 Infinite All objects in the universe 4 ","Weak nuclear force 10 – 13 Very short, Sub-nuclearsize (-10 -16 m) Some elementary particles, particularly electron and neutrino Electromagnetic force 10 – 2 Infinite Charged particles Strong nuclear force 1 Short, nuclear size (-10 -15 m) Nucleons, heavier elementary particles 5. Unification of Forces: There have been physicists who have tried to combine a few of the above fundamental forces. These are listed in table below. Name of Physicist Year Achievement in Unification Isaac Newton 1687 Unified celestial and terrestrial mechanics. Hans Christian Oersted and Michael Faraday 1820 and 1830 respectively Unified electric and magnetic phenomena to give rise to electromagnetism. James Clerk Maxwell 1873 Unified electricity, magnetism and optics to show that light is an electromagnetic wave. Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, Steven Weinberg Carlo Rubia, Simon Vander Meer 1979 1984 Gave the idea of electro-weak force which is a combination of electromagnetic and weak nuclear force. Verified the theory of elctro-weak force. Conserved Quantities Physics gives laws to summarize the investigations and observations of the phenomena occurring in the universe. o Physical quantities that remain constant with time are called conserved quantities . Example, for a body under external force, the kinetic and potential energy change over time but the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) remains constant. o Conserved quantities can be scalar (Energy) or vector (Total linear momentum and total angular momentum). 5 ","Conservation Laws A conservation law is a hypothesis based on observation and experiments which cannot be proved. These can be verified via experiments. Law of conservation of Energy o According to the general Law of conservation of energy , the energies remain constant over time and convert from one form to another. o The law of conservation of energy applies to the whole universe and it is believed that the total energy of the universe remains unchanged. o Under identical conditions, the nature produces symmetric results at different time. Law of conservation of Mass This is a principle used in analysis of chemical reactions. o A chemical reaction is basically a rearrangement of atoms among different molecules. o If the total binding energy of the reacting molecules is less than the total binding energy of the product molecules, the difference appears as heat and the reaction is exothermic . o The opposite is true for energy absorbing ( endothermic ) reactions. o Since the atoms are merely rearranged but not destroyed, the total mass of the reactants is the same as the total mass of the products in a chemical reaction . o Mass is related to energy through Einstein theory, E = mc 2 , where c is the speed of light in vacuum Law of conservation of linear momentum o Symmetry of laws of nature with respect to translation in space is termed as law of conservation of linear momentum. o Example law of gravitation is same on earth and moon even if the acceleration due to gravity at moon is 1/6 th than that at earth. 6 ","Law of conservation of angular momentum o Isotropy of space (no intrinsically preferred direction in space) underlies the law of conservation of angular momentum. 7 ","Units A unit is an internationally accepted standard for measurements of quantities. • Measurement consists of a numeric quantity along with a relevant unit. • Units for Fundamental or base quantities (like length, time etc.) are called Fundamental units . • Units which are combination of fundamental units are called Derived units . • Fundamental and Derived units together form a System of Units . • Internationally accepted system of units is SystèmeInternationale d’ Unites (French for International system of Units ) or SI . It was developed and recommended by General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1971 . • SI lists 7 base units as in the table below. Along with it, there are two units - radian or rad (unit for plane angle) and steradian or sr (unit for solid angle). They both are dimensionless . Base Quantity Name Symbol Length metre m Mass kilogram kg Time second s Electric Current ampere A Thermo dynamic Temperature kelvin K Amount of Substance mole mol Luminous intensity candela cd 2.3.1. Measuring large Distances – Parallax Method • Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. Distance between the two viewpoints is called Basis . Chapter 2 Units and Measurements 1 ","Measuring distance of a planet using parallax method Similarly, α = d/D Where α = angular size of the planet (angle subtended by d at earth) and d is the diameter of the planet.αis angle between the direction of the telescope when two diametrically opposite points of the planet are viewed. 2.3.2.Measuring very small distances To measure distances as low as size of a molecule, electron microscopes are used. These contain electrons beams controlled by electric and magnetic fields. • Electron microscopes have a resolution of 0.6 Å or Agstroms. • Electron microscopes are able to resolve atoms and molecules while using tunneling microscopy, it is possible to estimate size of molecule. Estimating size of molecule of Oleic acid Oleic acid is a soapy liquid with large molecular size of the order of 10 −9 ? . The steps followed in determining the size of molecule are: • Dissolve 1 cm 3 of oleic acid in alcohol to make a solution of 20 cm 3 .Take 1 cm 3 of above solution and dilute it to 20 cm 3 , using alcohol. Now, the concentration of oleic acid in the solution will be (1/(20x20)) cm 3 of oleic acid/ cm 3 of solution. • Sprinkle lycopodium powder on the surface of water in a trough and put one drop of above solution. The oleic acid in the solution will spread over water in a circular molecular thick film. • Measure the diameter of the above circular film using below calculations. • If n – Number of drops of solution in water, V – Volume of each drop, t – Thickness of the film, A – Area of the film Total volume of n drops of solution = nV cm 3 Amount of Oleic acid in this solution = ?𝑉 ( 1 20×20 ) cm 3 Thickness of the film = ? = 𝑉????? ?? ?ℎ? ?𝑖??

As a standard, atomic standard of time is now used, which is measured by Cesium or Atomic clock . • In Cesium clock, a second is equal to 9,192,631,770 vibrations of radiation from the transition between two hyperfine levels of cesium-133 atom. • Cesium clock works on the vibration of cesium atom which is similar to vibrations of balance wheel in a regular wristwatch and quartz crystal in a quartz wristwatch. • National standard time and frequency is maintained by 4 atomic clocks. Indian standard time is maintained by a Cesium clock at National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi. • Cesium clocks are very accurate and the uncertainty is very low 1 part in 10 13 which means not more than 3 μs are lost or gained in a year.

They can be systematic or random. • Accuracy of a measurement is how close the measured value is to the true value. • Precision is the resolution or closeness of a series of measurements of a same quantity under similar conditions. • If the true value of a certain length is 3.678 cm and two instruments with different resolutions, up to 1 (less precise) and 2 (more precise) decimal places respectively, are used. If first measures the length as 3.5 and the second as 3.38 then the first has more accuracy but less precision while the second has less accuracy and more precision. Types of Errors- Systematic Errors Errors which can either be positive or negative are called Systematic errors . They are of following types: 1. Instrumental errors : These arise from imperfect design or calibration error in the instrument. Worn off scale, zero error in a weighing scale are some examples of instrument errors. 2. Imperfections in experimental techniques : If the technique is not accurate (for example measuring temperature of human body by placing thermometer under armpit resulting in lower temperature than actual) and due to the external conditions like temperature, wind, humidity, these kinds of errors occur. 3. Personal errors : Errors occurring due to human carelessness, lack of proper setting, taking down incorrect reading are called personal errors. These errors can be removed by: o Taking proper instrument and calibrating it properly. o Experimenting under proper atmospheric conditions and techniques. Removing human bias as far as possible Random Errors Errors which occur at random with respect to sign and size are called Random errors . • These occur due to unpredictable fluctuations in experimental conditions like temperature, voltage supply, mechanical vibrations, personal errors etc. Least Count Error Smallest value that can be measured by the measuring instrument is called its least count . Least count error is the error associated with the resolution or the least count of the instrument. • Least count errors can be minimized by using instruments of higher precision/resolution and improving experimental techniques (taking several readings of a measurement and then taking a mean). Errors in a series of Measurements Suppose the values obtained in several measurement are a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , …, a n . Arithmetic mean, a mean = ( a 1 + a 2 + a 3 + … + a n )/n 𝑎 ??𝑎? =∑ 𝑎 𝑖 ? ? 𝑖=1 • Absolute Error : The magnitude of the difference between the true value of the quantity and the individual measurement value is called absolute error of the measurement. It 4 ","is denoted by |Δ a | (or Mod of Delta a). The mod value is always positive even if Δ a is negative. The individual errors are: Δa 1 = a mean - a 1 Δa 2 = a mean - a 2 , … … … … … … Δa n = a mean – a n • Mean absolute error is the arithmetic mean of all absolute errors. It is represented by Δ a mean . 𝛥𝑎 ??𝑎? = |𝛥𝑎1| + |𝛥𝑎2| + |𝛥𝑎3| + … . +|𝛥𝑎?| ? 𝛥𝑎 ??𝑎? =∑ |∆𝑎 𝑖 | ? ? 𝑖=1 For single measurement, the value of ‘a’ is always in the range 𝑎 ??𝑎? ± 𝛥𝑎 ??𝑎? So, 𝑎 = 𝑎 ??𝑎? ± 𝛥𝑎 ??𝑎? Or, 𝑎 ??𝑎? − 𝛥𝑎 ??𝑎? ≤ 𝑎≤𝑎 ??𝑎? + 𝛥𝑎 ??𝑎? • Relative Error : It is the ratio of mean absolute error to the mean value of the quantity measured. 𝑅𝑒?𝑎?𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝐸???? = 𝛥𝑎 ??𝑎? 𝑎 ??𝑎? • Percentage Error: It is the relative error expressed in percentage. It is denoted by δ a . 𝛿𝑎 = 𝛥𝑎 ??𝑎? 𝑎 ??𝑎? × 100% Combinations of Errors If a quantity depends on two or more other quantities, the combination of errors in the two quantities helps to determine and predict the errors in the resultant quantity. There are several procedures for this. Suppose two quantities A and B have values as A ± ΔA and B ± ΔB. Z is the result and ΔZ is the error due to combination of A and B. Criteria Sum or Difference Product Raised to Power Resultant value Z Z = A ± B Z = AB Z = A k Result with error Z ± ΔZ = (A ± ΔA) + (B ± ΔB) Z ± ΔZ = (A ± ΔA) (B ± ΔB) Z ± ΔZ = (A ± ΔA) k Resultant error range ± ΔZ = ± ΔA ± ΔB ΔZ/Z = ΔA/A ± ΔB/B Maximum error ΔZ = ΔA + ΔB ΔZ/Z = ΔA/A + ΔB/B ΔZ/Z = k(ΔA/A) Error Sum of absolute errors Sum of relative errors k times relative error Significant Figures Every measurement results in a number that includes reliable digits and uncertain digits. Reliable digits plus the first uncertain digit are called significant digits or significant figures .These indicate the precision of measurement which depends on least count of measuring instrument. Example, period of oscillation of a pendulum is 1.62 s. Here 1 and 6 are reliable and 2 is uncertain. Thus, the measured value has three significant figures. Rules for determining number of significant figures • All non-zero digits are significant. • All zeros between two non-zero digits are significant irrespective of decimal place. • For a value less than 1, zeroes after decimal and before non-zero digits are not significant. Zero before decimal place in such a number is always insignificant. 5 ","• Trailing zeroes in a number without decimal place are insignificant. • Trailing zeroes in a number with decimal place are significant. Cautions to remove ambiguities in determining number of significant figures • Change of units should not change number of significant digits . Example, 4.700m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm. In this, first two quantities have 4 but third quantity has 2 significant figures. • Use scientific notation to report measurements . Numbers should be expressed in powers of 10 like a x 10 b where b is called order of magnitude . Example, 4.700 ? = 4.700 × 10 2 𝑐? = 4.700 × 10 3 ?? = 4.700 × 10 −3 ?? In all the above, since power of 10 are irrelevant, number of significant figures are 4. • Multiplying or dividing exact numbers can have infinite number of significant digits. Example, radius = diameter / 2. Here 2 can be written as 2, 2.0, 2.00, 2.000 and so on. Rules for Arithmetic operation with Significant Figures Type Multiplication or Division Addition or Subtraction Rule The final result should retain as many significant figures as there in the original number with the lowest number of significant digits. The final result should retain as many decimal places as there in the original number with the least decimal places. Example Density = Mass / Volume Addition of 436.32 (2 digits after decimal), if mass = 4.237 g ( 4 significant figures ) and Volume = 2.51 cm 3 ( 3 significant figures ) Density = 4.237 g/2.51 cm 3 = 1.68804 g cm -3 = 1.69 g cm -3 ( 3 significant figures ) 227.2 (1 digit after decimal) &  .301 (3 digits after decimal) is = 663.821 Since 227.2 is precise up to only 1 decimal place, Hence, the final result should be 663.8 Rules for Rounding off the uncertain digits Rounding off is necessary to reduce the number of insignificant figures to adhere to the rules of arithmetic operation with significant figures. Rule Number Insignifica nt Digit Preceding Digit Example (roundin g off to two decimal places) 1 Insignifica nt digit to be dropped is more than 5 Preceding digit is raised by 1. Number – 3.137 Result – 3.14 2 Insignifica nt digit to be dropped is less than 5 Preceding digit is left unchange d. Number – 3.132 Result – 3.13 6 ","3 Insignifica nt digit to be dropped is equal to 5 If preceding digit is even, it is left unchange d. Number – 3.125 Result – 3.12 4 Insignifica nt digit to be dropped is equal to 5 If preceding digit is odd, it is raised by 1. Number – 3.135 Result – 3.14 Rules for determining uncertainty in results of arithmetic calculations To calculate the uncertainty, below process should be used. • Add a lowest amount of uncertainty in the original numbers. Example uncertainty for 3.2 will be ± 0.1 and for 3.22 will be ± 0.01. Calculate these in percentage also. • After the calculations, the uncertainties get multiplied/divided/added/subtracted. • Round off the decimal place in the uncertainty to get the final uncertainty result. Example, for a rectangle, if length l = 16.2 cm and breadth b = 10.1 cm Then, take l = 16.2 ± 0.1 cm or 16.2 cm ± 0.6% and breadth = 10.1 ± 0.1 cm or 10.1 cm ± 1%. On Multiplication, area = length x breadth = 163.62 cm 2 ± 1.6% or 163.62 ± 2.6 cm 2 . Therefore after rounding off, area = 164 ± 3 cm 2 . Hence 3 cm 2 is the uncertainty or the error in estimation. Rules 1. For a set experimental data of ‘n’ significant figures, the result will be valid to ‘n’ significant figures or less (only in case of subtraction). Example 12.9 - 7.06 = 5.84 or 5.8 (rounding off to lowest number of decimal places of original number). 2. The relative error of a value of number specified to significant figures depends not only on n but also on the number itself. Example, accuracy for two numbers 1.02 and 9.89 is ±0.01. But relative errors will be: For 1.02, (± 0.01/1.02) x 100% = ± 1% For 9.89, (± 0.01/9.89) x 100% = ± 0.1% Hence, the relative error depends upon number itself. 3. Intermediate results in multi-step computation should be calculated to one more significant figure in every measurement than the number of digits in the least precise measurement. Example:1/9.58 = 0.1044 Now, 1/0.104 = 9.56 and 1/0.1044 = 9.58 Hence, taking one extra digit gives more precise results and reduces rounding off errors. Dimensions of a Physical Quantity Dimensions of a physical quantity are powers (exponents) to which base quantities are raised to represent that quantity. They are represented by square brackets around the quantity. • Dimensions of the 7 base quantities are – Length [L], Mass [M], time [T], electric current [A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous intensity [cd] and amount of substance [mol]. Examples, Volume = Length x Breadth x Height = [L] x [L] x [L] = [L] 3 = [L 3 ] Force = Mass x Acceleration = [M][L]/[T] 2 = [MLT -2 ] • The other dimensions for a quantity are always 0. For example, for volume only length has 3 dimensions but the mass, time etc have 0 dimensions. Zero dimension is represented by superscript 0 like [M 0 ]. 7 ","Dimensions do not take into account the magnitude of a quantity Dimensional Formula and Dimensional Equation Dimensional Formula is the expression which shows how and which of the base quantities represent the dimensions of a physical quantity. Dimensional Equation is an equation obtained by equating a physical quantity with its dimensional formula. Physical Quantity Dimensional Formula Dimensional Equation Volume [M 0 L 3 T 0 ] [V] = [M 0 L 3 T 0 ] Speed [M 0 L T -1 ] [ υ ] = [M 0 L T -1 ] Force [M L T -2 ] [F] = [M L T -2 ] Mass Density [M L -3 T 0 ] [ρ] = [M L -3 T 0 ] Dimensional Analysis • Only those physical quantities which have same dimensions can be added and subtracted. This is called principle of homogeneity of dimensions . • Dimensions can be multiplied and cancelled like normal algebraic methods. • In mathematical equations, quantities on both sides must always have same dimensions. • Arguments of special functions like trigonometric, logarithmic and ratio of similar physical quantities are dimensionless. • Equations are uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities. Example Distance = Speed x Time. In Dimension terms, [𝐿] = [𝐿𝑇 −1 ] × [𝑇] Since, dimensions can be cancelled like algebra, dimension [T] gets cancelled and the equation becomes [L] = [L]. Applications of Dimensional Analysis Checking Dimensional Consistency of equations • A dimensionally correct equation must have same dimensions on both sides of the equation. • A dimensionally correct equation need not be a correct equation but a dimensionally incorrect equation is always wrong. It can test dimensional validity but not find exact relationship between the physical quantities. Example, 𝑥 = 𝑥 0 + 𝑣 0 ? + ( 1 2 ) 𝑎? 2 Or, Dimensionally, [L] = [L] + [LT -1 ][T] + [LT -2 ][T 2 ] Where, x – Distance travelled in time t, x 0 – starting position, v 0 - initial velocity, a – uniform acceleration. Dimensions on both sides will be [L] as [T] gets cancelled out. Hence this is dimensionally correct equation. Deducing relation among physical quantities • To deduce relation among physical quantities, we should know the dependence of one quantity over others (or independent variables) and consider it as product type of dependence. • Dimensionless constants cannot be obtained using this method. Example, T = k l x g y m z Or [L 0 M 0 T 1 ] = [L 1 ] x [L 1 T -2 ] y [M 1 ] z = [L x+y T -2y M z ] Means, x+y = 0, -2y = 1 and z = 0. So, x = ½, y = -½ and z = 0 So the original equation reduces to 𝑇 = ? √ ? ? 8 ","uni0049uni004Duni0050uni004Funi0052uni0054uni0041uni004Euni0054uni0054uni0045uni0052uni004Duni0053

KINEMATICS OF SYSTEM OF PARTICLES 1.1 System of particles can move in different ways as observed by us in daily life. To understand that we need to understand few new parameters. (a) Angular Displacement Consider a particle moves from A to B in the following figures. A B O A B O Angle is the angular displacement of particle about O. Units  radian (b) Angular Velocity The rate of change of angular displacement is called as angular velocity. A B O A B O d dt   d dt   Units  Rad/s It is a vector quantity whose direction is given by right hand thumb rule. According to right hand thumb rule, if we curl the fingers of right hand along with the body, then right hand thumb gives us the direction of angular velocity. It is always along the axis of the motion. (c) Angular Acceleration Angular acceleration of an object about any point is rate of change of angular velocity about that point. A B A B d dt   d dt   Units  Rad/s 2 It is a vector quantity. If  is constant then similarly to equation of motion (i.e.)  t are related  =  0 +  t 2 0 1 t t 2      2 2 f 0 2     1.2 Various types of motion (a) Translational Motion System is said to be in translational motion, if all the particles lying in the system have same linear velocity. Example Motion of a rod as shown. ROTATION MOTION ROTATIONAL MOTION ","ROTATION MOTION Example Motion of body of car on a straight rod. In both the above examples, velocity of all the particles is same as they all have equal displacements in equal intervals of time. (b) Rotational Motion A system is said to be in pure rotational motion, when all the points lying on the system are in circular motion about one common fixed axis. A B D C O B B B A A A O In pure rotational motion. Angular velocity of all the points is same about the fixed axis. (c) Rotational + Translational A system is said to be in rotational + translational motion, when the particle is rotating with some angular velocity about a movable axis. For example : O v v v = velocity of axis.  = Angular velocity of system about O. 1.3 Inter Relationship between kinematics variable In general if a body is rotating about any axis (fixed or movable), with angular velocity  and angular acceleration  then velocity of any point p with respect to axis is v r      and 2 a r r       . i.e., O r P v p a p v r      2 a r r       Example v B O L A B L/2 v B =  L and A L v , 2   with directions as shown in figure. Now in rotational + translational motion, we just superimpose velocity and acceleration of axis on the velocity and acceleration of any point about the axis. (i.e.) O v Q P i j PO ˆ v Ri   0 ˆ v vi    P 0 PO v v v       P PO O v v v      ˆ R vi   Similarly QO ˆ v Rj   0 ˆ v vi    Q ˆ ˆ v vi Rj    Inter-relation between v of axis and  or a of axis and  depends on certain constraints. ","ROTATION MOTION General we deal with the case of no slipping or pure rolling. O v Platform v P No slipping The constraint in the above case is that velocity of points of contact should be equal for both rolling body and playfrom. (i.e.) v – r  = v P If platform is fixed then v P = 0  v r  An differentiating the above term we get dv rd dt dt   . Now if dv a dt  d dt   v a then a r  Remember if acceleration is assumed opposite to velocity then dv a dt  instead of dv a dt  . Similary : If  and  are in opposite direction the d dt   . Accordingly the constraints can change depending upon the assumptions. 2. ROTATIONAL DYNAMICS 2.1 Torque Similar to force, the cause of rotational motion is a physical quantity called a torque. Torque incorporates the following factors.  Amount of force.  Point of application of force.  Direction of application of force. Combining all of the above. Torque  = rf sin  about a point O. Where r = distance from the point O to point of application of force. f= force  = angle between r and f   A f r  Torque about O.  A is point of application of force. Magnitude of torque can also be rewritten as rf   or rf   where f  = component of force in the direction  to r  . r  = component of force in the direction  to f  . Direction : Direction of torque is given by right hand thumb rule. If we curl the fingers of right hand from first vector  r  to second vector  f  then right hand thumb gives us direction of their cross product.  Torque is always defined about a point or about an axis.  When there are multiple forces, the net torque needs to be calculated, (i.e.) 1 2 n net F F F ...........         All torque about same point/axis. If 0,  then the body is in rotational equilibrium.  If F 0   along with 0  , then body is in mechanical equilibrium.  If equal and opp. force act to produce same torque then they constitutes a couple.  For calculating torque, it is very important to find the eff. point of application of force.  Mg  Acts at com/centre of gravity.  N  Point of application depends upon situation to situation.

MOMENT OF INERTIA 3.1 Moment of inertia of Continuous Bodies When the distribution of mass of a system of particle is continuous, the discrete sum 2 i i r m I   is replaced by an integral. The moment of inertia of the whole body takes the form   dm r I 2 dm r Keep in mind that here the quantity r is the perpendicular distance to an axis, not the distance to an origin. To evaluate this integral, we must express m in terms of r. Comparing the expression of rotational kinetic energy with 1/2 mv 2 , we can say that the role of moment of inertia (I) is same in rotational motion as that of mass in linear motion. It is a measure of the resistance offered by a body to a change in its rotational motion. 3.2 Moment of Inertia of some important bodies 1.

Parallel Axis Theorem : Let I cm be the moment of inertia of a body about an axis through its centre of mass and Let I p be the moment of inertia of the same body about another axis which is parallel to the original one. If d is the distance between these two parallel axes and M is the mass of the body then according to the parallel axis theorem : I CM I P CM P d I p = I cm + Md 2 2. Perpendicular Axis Theorem : Consider a plane body (i.e., a plate of zero thickness) of mass M. Let X and Y axes be two mutually perpendicular lines in the plane of the body. The axes intersect at origin O. Z Y X Let I x = moment of inertia of the body about X–axis. Let I y = moment of inertia of the body about Y–axis. The moment of inertia of the body about Z–axis (passing through O and perpendicular to the plane of the body) is given by : I z = I x + I y The above result is known as the perpendicular axis theorem. ","ROTATION MOTION 3.4 Radius of Gyration If M is the mass and I is the moment of inertia of a rigid body, then the radius of gyration (k) of a body is given by : M I k  4.

Backward Slipping + = v v v v=0 v+ v Translation Rotation Rolling (Sliding) f –v The bottom most point slides in the backward direction w.r.t. ground, so friction force acts opposite to velocity i.e. friction will act in the direction of motion e.g. When car starts on a slippery ground, its wheels has small ‘v’ but large ‘  r’ so wheels slips on the ground and friction acts against slipping. 6.1 Rolling and sliding motion on an inclined plane h Pure Rolling h Sliding ","ROTATION MOTION Physical Quantity Rolling Sliding Falling Velocity     / gh 2 V R gh 2 V S  gh 2 V F  Acceleration a R = g sin  /  a S = g sin  a F = g Time of descend   g / h 2 sin / 1 t R      g / h 2 sin / 1 t S   g / h 2 t F  (where  = [1 + I/Mr 2 ])  Velocity of falling and sliding bodies are equal and is more than rollings.  Acceleration is maximum in case of falling and minimum in case of rolling.  Falling body reaches the bottom first while rolling last. ","1. INTRODUCTION The constitutents of the universe are galaxy, stars, planets, comets, asteriods, meteroids. The force which keeps them bound together is called gravitational force. Gravitation is a nature phenomenon by which material objects attract towards one another. In 1687 A.D. English Physicist, Sir Isaac Netwon published principia Mathematica, which explains the inverse-square law of gravitation. 2. NEWTON’S LAW OF GRAVITATION 2. 1 Defintion Every particle of matter attracts every other particle of matter with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. 2.2 Mathematical Form If m 1 and m 2 are the masses of the particles and r is the distance between them, the force of attraction F between the particles is given by 1 2 2 mm F r   1 2 2 mm F G r  Where G is the universal constant of gravitation. 2.3 Vector Form In vector form, Newton’s law of gravitation is represented in the following manner. The force   21 F  exerted on particle m 2 by particle m 1 is given by,   1 2 21 12 2 mm ˆ F G r r   ...(i) Where   12 ˆ r is a unit vector drawn from particle m 1 to particle m 2 .

UNIVERSAL CONSTANT OF GRAVITATION Universal gravitation constant is given as, G = 2 1 2 Fr mm Suppose that, m 1 = m 2 = 1, and r = 1 then G = F  Universal gravitation constant is numerically equal to the force of attraction between two unit masses placed at unit distance apart. 3.1 Unit SI unit :     2 2 2 2 newton metre Nm = kg kilogram CGS Unit : dyne cm 2 /gm 2 3.2 Value of G G = 6.67 × 10 –11 Nm 2 /kg 2 Dimensions of G [G] =    2 1 2 F r mm     = 1 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 M LT M LT M LT           = [M –1 L 3 T –2 ] GRAVITATION GRAVITATION ","GRAVITATION 1. The gravitational force is independent of the intervening medium. 2. The gravtional force is a conservative force. 3. The force exerted by the first particle on the second is exactly equal and opposite to the force exerted by the second particle on the first. 4. The gravitational force between two particles act along the line joining the two particles and they from an action-reaction pair. 4. VARIATION IN ‘g’ 4.1 The Acceleration due to Gravity at a height h above the Earth’s surface Let M and R be the mass and radius of the earth and g be the acceleratio due to gravity at the earth’s surface. Suppose that a body of mass m is placed on the surface of the earth. The weight ‘mg’ of the body is equal to the gravitational force acting on it.  2 GMm mg R   2 GM g R  ...(i) Now suppose that the body is raised to a height h, above the earth’s surface, the weight of the body is now mg h and the gravitational force acting on it is   2 GMm R h     h 2 GMm mg R h      h 2 GM g R h   ...(ii) Dividing eq (ii) by eq (i), we get,   2 h 2 g R g R h      2 h 2 R g g R h          4.2 Acceleration due to gravity at a very small height 2 h R h g g R         2 h g1 R          2 2 2h h g1 ........

A body at the point B will experience force only due to the portion of the earth of radius OB (R – d). The outer spherical shell, whose thickness is d, will not exert any force on body at point B. Because it will acts as a shell and point is inside.

Hence the net force of attraction exerted by the earth of the particle and directed towards the centre of the earth is given by mg ’ = mg – mr  2 cos  where g ’ is the value of the acceleration due to gravity at the point P. R R mg r P  g ’ = g – r  2 cos  Now, r = R cos  (where R is the radius of the earth) Then g ’ = g – (R cos  )  2 cos   g ’ = g – R  2 cos 2  The effective acceleration due to gravity at a point ‘P’ is given by, g ’ = g – R  2 cos 2  . Thus value of ‘g’ changes with ‘  ’ and ‘  ’ 1. At poles,  = 90, g ’ = g – R  2 cos 2 90. g ’ = g This is maximum acceleration due to gravity. 2. At equator  = 0, g ’ = g – R  2 cos 2 0 g ’ = g – R  2 This is minimum acceleration due to gravity. The variation of acceleration due to gravity according to the depth and the height from the earth’s surface can be expressed with help of following graph.

SATELLITE 5.1 Definition Any smaller body which revolves around another larer body under the influence of its gravitation is called a satellite. The satellite may be natural or artificial. 1. The moon which revolves around the earth, is a satellite of the earth. There are sixteen satellites revolving around the planet Jupiter. These satellite are called natural satellites. ","GRAVITATION 2. A satellite made and launched into circular orbit by man is called an artificial satellite. The first satellite was launched by USSR named SPUTNIK–I and the first Indian satellite was ‘ARYABHATTA’. 5.2 Minimum two stage rocket is used to project a satellite in a cirular orbit round a planet Suppose that a single stage launching system (i.e. a rocket), carrying satellite at its tip, is used to project the satellite from the surface of the earth. When the fuel in the rocket is ignited, the rocket begins to move upwards. The rocket attains maximum velocity when all the fule is exhausted. 1. If the maximum velocity attained by the rocket is equal to or greater than the escape velocity, the rocket overcomes the eath’s gravitational influence and escapes into space alogn with the satellite. 3. If the maximum velocity attained by the rocket is less escape velocity, the rocket cannot overcome the earth’s gravitational influence and both the rocket and the satellite eventually fall on the earth’s surface due to gravity. Thus a single stage rocket is unable to launch a satellite in a circular orbit round the earth. Therefore a launching system (i.e. a rocket) having two or more stages must be used to launch a satellite in a circular orbit round the earth. 5.3 Different cases of Projection When a satellite is taken to some height above the earth and then projected in the horizontal direction, the following four cases may occur, depending upon the magnitude of the horizontal velocity. 1. If the velocity of the projection is less than the critical velocity then the satellite moves in elliptical orbit, but the point of projection is apogee and int he orbit, the satellite comes closer to the earth with its perigee point lying at 180°. If it enters the atmosphere while coming towards perigee it will loose energy and spirally comes down. If it does not enters the atmosphere it will contiune to move in elliptical orbit. 2. If the velocity of the projection is equal to the critical velocity then the satellite moves in circular orbit round the earth. 3. If the velocity of the projection is greater than the critical velocity but less than the escape velocity, then the satellite moves in elliptical orbit and its apoagee, or point of greatest distance from the earth, will be greater than projection height. 4. If the velocity of the projection is equals to the escape velocity, then the satellite moves in parabolic path. 5. It the velocity of the projection is greater than the escape velocity, then orbit will hyperbolic and will escape the gravitational pull of the earth and continue to travel infinitely. 6. ORBITAL VELOCITY 6.1 Definition The horizontal velocity with which a satellite must be projected from a point above the earth’s surface, so that it revolves in a circular orbit round the earth, is called the orbital velocity of the satellite. 6.2 An Expression for the Critical Velocity of a Satellite revolving round the Earth Suppose that a satellite of mass m is raised to a height h above the earth’s surface and then projected in a horizontal direction with the orbital velocity v c . The satellite begins to move round the earth in a circular orbit of radius, R + h, where R is the radius of the earth.

","GRAVITATION ","GRAVITATION 8. GRAVITATIONAL FIELD The space surrounding any mass is called a gravitational feld. If any other mass is brought in this space, it is acted upon by a gravitational force. In short, the space in which any mass experiences a gravitational force, is called a gravitational field. 9. GRAVITATIONAL INTENSITY The gravitational intensity at any point in a gravitational field is defined as the force acting on a unit mass placed at that point. 1. The gravitational intensity (E) at a point at distrance r from a point mass M is given by 2 GM E r  (Where G is the constant of gravitation.) 2. If a point mass m is placed in a gravitational field of intensity E, the force (F) acting on the mass m is given by F = mE. 10. GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL The gravitational potential at any point in a gravitational field is defined as the work done to bring a unit mass from infinity to that point. 1. The gravitational potential (V) at a point at distance r from a point mass M is given by, GM V r  (Where G is the constant of gravitation) 2. The work done on a unit mass is converted into its potential energy. Thus, the gravitational potential at any point is equal to the potential energy of a unit mass placed at that point. 3.

Binding Energy of a satellite The minimum energy which must be supplied to a satellite, so that it can escape from the earth’s gravitation field, is called the binding energy of a satellite.

ESCAPE VELOCITY OF A BODY 11.1 Expression for the escape velocity of a body at rest on the earth’s surface The minimum velocity with which a body should be projected from the surface of the earth, so that it escapes from the earth’s gravitational field, is called the escape velocity. Thus, if a body or a satellite is given the escape velocity, its kinetic energy of projection will be equal to its binding energy.

COMMUNICATION SATELLITE An artificial satellite revolving in a circular obrit round the earth in the same sense of the rotational of the earth and having same period of revolution as the period of rotation of the earth (i.e. 1 day = 24 hours = 86400 seconds) is called as geo-stationary or communication satellite. As relative velocity of the satellite with respective to the earth is zero it appears stationary from the earth’s surface. Therefore it is know as geo-stationary satellite or geosynchronous satellite. 1. The height of the communication satellite above the earth’s surface is about 36000 km and its period of revolution is 24 hours or 24 × 60 × 60 seconds. 2. The satellite appears to be at rest, because its speed relative to the earth is zero, hence it is called as geostationary or geosynchronous satellite. 12.1 Uses of the communication satellite 1. For sending TV signals over large distances on the earth’s surface. 2. Telecommunication. 3. Weather forescasting. 4. For taking photographs of astronomical objects. 5. For studying of solar and cosmic radations. 13. WEIGHTLESSNESS 1. The gravitational force with which a body is attracted towards the centre of earth is called the weight of body. Weightlessness is a moving satellite is a feeling. It is not due to weight equal to zero. 2. When an astronaut is on the surface of earth, gravitational force acts on him. This gravitational force is the weight of astronaut and astronant exerts this force on the surface of earth. The surface of earth exerts an equal and opposte reaction and due to this reaction he feels his weight on the earth. 3. for an astronaut in an orbiting satellite, the satellite and astronaut both have same acceleration towards the centre ","GRAVITATION of earth and this acceleration is equal to the acceleration due to gravity of earth. 4. Therefore astronaunt does not produce any action on the floor of the satellite. Naturally the floor does not exert any force of reaction on the astronaut. As there is no reaction, the astronaut has a feeling of weightlessness. (i.e. no sense of his own weight). 1. The sensation of weightlessness experienced by an aastronaut is not the result of there being zero gravitational acceleration, but of there being zero difference between the acceleration of the spacecraft and the acceleration of the astronaut. 2. The most common problem experienced by astronauts in the initial hours of weightlessness is known as space adaptation snydrome (space sickness). 14. KEPLER’S LAWS 14.1 Law of Orbit Each Planet move surround the sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one of the foci as shown in figure. The eccentricity of an ellipse is defined as the ratio of the distance SO and AO i.e. AO SO e   ea SO a SO e   The distance of closest approach with sun at F 1 is AS. This distance is called perigee. The greatest distance (BS) of the planet from the sun is called apogee. Perigee (AS) = AO – OS = a – ea = a (1 – e) apogee (BS) = OB + OS = a + ea = a (1 + e) 14.2 Law of Area The line joining the sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. A planet takes the same time to travel from A to B as from C to D as shown in figure. (The shaded areas are equal). Naturally the planet has to move faster from C to D. time swept area velocity Areal    cosntant dt d r 2 1 dt rd r 2 1 2      Hence 2 1 r 2  = constant. 14.3 Law of Periods The square of the time for the planet to complete a revolution about the sun is proportional to the cube of semimajor axis of the elliptical orbit. i.e. Centripetal force = Gravitational force 2 2 2 v R GM R GMm R mv    Now, velocity of the planet is T R 2 period Time orbit circular the of nce Circumfere v    Substituting Value in above equation GM R 4 T or T R 4 R GM 3 2 2 2 2 2      Since          GM 4 2 is constant, constant R T or R T 3 2 3 2    ","GRAVITATION 14.4 Gravity Gravity is the force of attraction exerted by earth towards is centre on a body lying on or near the surface of earth. Gravity is merely a special case of gravitation and is also called earth’s gravitational pull. Weight of a body is defined as the force of attraction exerted by the earth on the body towards its centre. The units and dimenstions of gravity pull or weight are the same as those of force. Astronomical Data 14.5 Intertial mass Inertial mass of a body is related to its inertia in linear motion; and is defined by Newton’s second law of motion. Let a body of mass m i move with acceleration a under the action of an external force F. According to Newton’s second law of motion, F = m i a or m i = F/a Thus, inertial mass of a body is equal to the magnitude of external force required to produce unit acceleration in the body. 14.6 Gravitational mass Gravitational mass of a body is related to gravitational pull on the body, and is defined by Newton’s law of gravitational. LAUNCHING OF AN ARTIFICIAL SATELLITE AROUND EARTH The satellite is placed upon the rocket which is launched from the earth. After the rocket reaches its maximum vertical height h, a spherical mechanism gives a thrust to the satellite at point A (figure) producing a horizontal velocity v. The total energy of the satellite at A is thus, h R GMm mv 2 1 E 2    The orbit will be an ellipse (closed path), a parabola, or an hyperbola depending on whether E is negative, zero, or positive. In all cases the centre of the earth is at one focus of the path. If the energy is too low, the elliptical orbit will intersect the earth and the satellite will fall back. Otherwise it will keep moving in a closed orbit, or will escape from the earth, depending on the values of v and R. Hence a satellite carried to a height h (<< R) and given a horizontal velocity of 8 km/sec will be placed almost in a circular orbit around the earth (figure). If launched at less than 8 km/sec, it would get closer and closer to earth until it hits the ground. Thus 8 km/sec is the critical (minimum) velocity. G 2 GM m F R  or   G 2 F F m I GM / R   The mass m G of the body in this sence is the gravitational mass of the body. The intertia of the body has no effect on the gravitational mass of the body. m G = F Thus, Gravitational mass of a body is defined as the magnitude of gravitational pull experienced by the body in a gravitational field of unit intensity. 14.7 Centre of Gravity Centre of gravity of a body placed in the gravitational field is that point where the net gravitational force of the field acts. ","Mechanical Properties of Solids 1. Introduction A rigid body generally means a hard solid object having a definite shape and size. But in reality, bodies can be stretched, compressed and bent. Even the appreciably rigid steel bar can be deformed when a sufficiently large external force is applied on it. This means that solid bodies are not perfectly rigid. A solid has definite shape and size. In order to change (or deform) the shape or size of a body, a force is required. 2. Deforming Force A force which produces a change in configuration (size or shape) of the object on applying it, is called a deforming force. 3. Elasticity Elasticity is that property of the object by virtue of which it regains its original configuration after the removal of the deforming force. For example, if we stretch a rubber band and release it, it snaps back to its original length. 4. Perfectly Elastic Body Those bodies which regain its original configuration immediately and completely after the removal of deforming force are called perfectly elastic bodies. The nearest approach to a perfectly elastic body is quartz fibre. 5. Plasticity If a body does not regains its original size and shape completely and immediately after the removal of deforming force, it is said to be a plastic body and this property is called plasticity. 6. Perfectly plastic body That body which does not regain its original configuration at all on the removal of deforming force are called perfectly plastic bodies.Putty and paraffin wax are nearly perfectly plastic bodies. 7. Stress If a body gets deformed under the action of an external force, then at each section of the body an internal force of reaction is set up which tends to restore the body into its original state. 7.1 Definition The internal restoring force set up per unit area of cross section of the deformed body is called stress. 7.2 Mathematical Form Stress = Applied Force 𝐴??𝑎 Its unit is N/m2 or Pascal. Its dimensional formula is [ML -1 T -2 ]. 7.3 Types of stress There are three different types of stress 1. Longitudinal Stress 1 ","Mechanical Properties of Solids If deforming force is applied normal to the area of cross section, then the stress is called longitudinal stress. It is further categorized in two types (a) Tensile stress If there is an increase in length of the object under the effect of applied force, then stress is called tensile stress. (b) Compressional stress If there is a decrease in length of the object under the effect of applied force, then stress is called compression stress. 2. Tangential or Shearing Stress If deforming force acts tangentially to the surface of a body, it produces a change in the shape of the body. The tangential force applied per unit area is called tangential stress. 3. Normal Stress If a body is subjected to a uniform force from all sides, then the corresponding stress is called hydrostatic stress. 8.Strain When a deforming force acts on a body, the body undergoes a change in its shape and size. The fractional change in configuration is called strain . 8.1 Mathematical Equation Strain = change in dimension original dimension It has no unit and it is a dimensionless quantity . According to the change in configuration, the strain is of three types (1) longitudinal strain = change in length original length (2) Volumetric strain = change in volume Original volume (3) 𝑆ℎ?𝑎?𝑖?𝑔 ???𝑎𝑖? tangential applied force Area of face 9. Hooke’s Law Robert Hook found that within the elastic limit, the stress is directly proportional to strain. Thus we have ???𝒆?? ∝ ???𝒂𝒊𝒏 or ???𝒆?? = 𝑲. ???𝒂𝒊𝒏 where K is the constant of proportionality called “ Elastic M odulus” of the material. There are some materials that do not obey Hooke’s law like rubber, human’s muscle. 9.1 Types of Modulus of rigidity 9.1.1 Young’s Modulus of rigidity (Y) 2 ","Mechanical Properties of Solids It is defined as the ratio of normal stress to the longitudinal strain within the elastic limit. Y= ???𝑔𝑖???𝑖?𝑎? ?????? Longitudinal strain It has same units as stress because strain does not have any unit. Y is measured in N/m 2 or Pa. Metals generally have large values of Young’s modulus compare to other materials. In scientific terms, the higher the Young’s modulus of the material the more elastic it is. 9.1.2 Bulk Modulus of Rigidity κ= ????𝑎? ?????? Volumetric strain or κ= −𝐹/𝐴 ∆V/V = - pV/ ∆𝑉 The SI unit of bulk modulus is N/m 2 Compressibility Compressibility of a material is the reciprocal of its bulk modulus of elasticity. Compressibility (C) = 1 / k Its SI unit is N-1m 2 and CGS unit is dyne -1 cm 2 . 9.1.3 Modulus of rigidity or shear Modulus ( 𝜼) 𝜼= ?𝑎?𝑔???𝑖𝑎? ?????? shear  strain 𝜼= 𝐹 𝐴 ϒ = 𝐹 𝐴ϒ 𝜼= 𝐹 Aϒ The SI unit of shear modulus is N/m 2 The shear modulus of a material is always considerably smaller than the Young’s modulus for it. 10. Limit of elasticity The maximum value of deforming force for which elasticity is present in the body is called its limit of elasticity. 3 ","Mechanical Properties of Solids 11.Stress- strain Curve Figure shows the stress-strain curve for a metal wire which is gradually being loaded. (a) The initial part OA of the graph is a straight line indicating that stress is proportional to strain. Upto the point A, Hooke’s law is obeyed. The point A is called the proportional limit. In this region, the wire is perfectly elastic. (b) After the point A, the stress is not proportional to strain and a curved portion AB is obtained. However, if the load is removed at any point between O and B, the curve is retraced along BAO and the wire attains its original length. The portion OB of the graph is called elastic region and the point B is called elastic limit or yield point. The stress corresponding to B is called yield strength. (c) Beyond the point B, the strain increases more rapidly than stress. If the load is removed at any point C, the wire does not come back to its original length but traces dashed line. Even on reducing the stress to zero, a residual strain equal to OE is left in the wire. The material is said to have acquired a permanent set. The fact that stress-strain curve is not retraced on reversing the strain is called elastic hysteresis. (d) If the load is increased beyond the point C, there is large increase in the strain or the length of the wire. In this region, the constrictions ( called necks and waists) develop at few points along the length of the wire and the wire breaks ultimately at the point D, called the fracture point. In the region between B and D, the length of the wire goes on increasing even without any addition of load. This region is called plastic region and material is said to undergo plastic flow or plastic deformation. The stress corresponding to the braking point is called ultimate strength or tensile strength of the material. 12. Elastic after Effect The bodies return to their original state on the removal of the deforming force. Some bodies return to their original state immediately after the removal of the deforming force while some bodies take longer time to do so. The delay in regaining the original state by a body on the removal of the deforming force is called elastic after effect. 13. Elastic Fatigue The property of an elastic body by virtue of which its behavior becomes less elastic 4 ","Mechanical Properties of Solids under the action of repeated alternating deforming force is called elastic fatigue. 14. Ductile Materials The materials which have large plastic range of extension are called ductile materials. Such materials undergo an irreversible increase in length before snapping. So they can be drawn into thin wires. For e.g. copper, silver, iron, aluminium etc. 15 Brittle Materials The materials which have very small range of plastic extension are called brittle materials. Such materials break as soon as the stress is increased beyond the elastic limit. For e.g. cast iron, glass, ceramics etc. 16. Elastomers The materials for which strain produced is much larger than the stress applied, with in the limit of elasticity are called elastomers, e.g., rubber, the elastic tissue of aorta, the large vessel carrying blood from heart. etc. Elastomers have no plastic range . 17. Elastic Potential Energy of stretched wire When a wire is stretched, interatomic forces come into play which opposes the change. Work has to done against these restoring forces. The work done in stretching the wire is stored in it as its elastic potential energy. 18. Poisson’s Ratio When a deforming force is applied at the free end of a suspended wire of length 1 and diameter D, then its length increases by ∆ l but its diameter decreases by ∆𝐷 . Now two types of strains are produced by a single force. (i) Longitudinal strain = ∆𝑙 𝑙 (ii) Lateral strain = – −∆𝐷 D ∴ Poisson ’ s Ratio ( σ ) = 𝐿𝑎???𝑎𝑙 ???𝑎𝑖? 𝑙??𝑔𝑖???𝑖?𝑎𝑙 ???𝑎𝑖? = = −∆𝐷 D ∆𝑙 𝑙 = − 𝑙∆𝐷 𝐷∆𝑙 The negative sign shows that longitudinal and lateral strains are in opposite sense. As Poisson’s ratio is the ratio of two strains, it has no units and dimensions. The theoretical value of Poisson’s ratio lies between – 1 and 0.5. Its practical value lies between 0 and 0.5 19. Applications of elasticity The elastic behavior of materials plays an important role in everyday life. All engineering designs require precise knowledge of the elastic behavior of materials. For example while designing a building, the structural design of the columns, beams and supports require knowledge of strength of materials used. A bridge has to be designed such that it can withstand the load of the flowing traffic, the force of winds and its own weight. Similarly, in the design of buildings use of beams and 5 ","Mechanical Properties of Solids columns is very common. In both the cases, the overcoming of the problem of bending of beam under a load is of prime importance. The beam should not bend too much or break. Let us consider the case of a beam loaded at the centre and supported near its ends as shown in Fig. A bar of length l, breadth b, and depth d when loaded at the centre by a load W sags by an amount given by δ = W l 3 /(4bd 3 Y) Bending can be reduced by using a material with a large Young’s modulus Y. Depression can be decreased more effectively by increasing the depth d rather than the breadth b. But a deep bar has a tendency to bend under the weight of a moving traffic, hence a better choice is to have a bar of I-shaped cross section. This section provides a large load bearing surface and enough depth to prevent bending. Also this shape reduces the weight of the beam without sacrificing its strength and hence reduces the cost. 6 ","uni0031uni002E

THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER In this topic, we discuss various phenomenas involving thermal and how does a matter behave on experiencing the flow of thermal energy. Primarily we study • Thermal Expansion • Heat & Clariometry • Heat Transfer 1.1 Temperature and Heat Temperature : Temperature is a relative measure of hotness or coldness of a body. SI Unit : Kelvin (k) Commonly Used Unit : °C or °F Conversion : t (k) = t °C + 273.15 Heat : Heat is a form of energy flow (i) between two bodies or (ii) between a body and its surroundings by virtue of temperature difference between them SI Unit : Joule (J) Commonly Used Unit : Calorie (Cal) Conversion : 1cal = 4.186 J • Heat always flows from a higher temperature system to a lower temperature & system. 1.2 Measurement of Temperature Principle : Observation of Thermometric property with the change in temperature and comparing it with certain reference situations. • Reference situation is generally ice point or steam point. 1.2.1 Celcius and Fahrenheit Temperature Scales In Celsius Scale In Fahrenheit Scale Ice point  0°C Ice point  32°F Steam point  1000°C Steam point  212°F It implies that 100 division in celcius scales is equivalent to 180 scale divisions in fahrenheit scale.

It is based on the fact that at low pressures and constant volume, P × T for a gas. Gas A Gas B Temperature (°C) Pressure 0°C –273.15°C • All gases converge to absolute zero at zero pressure. 1.3 Thermal Expansion It is widely observed, that most materials expand on heating and contract on colling. This expansion is in all dimensions. Experimentaly it has been observed that fractional change in any dimension is proportional to the change in temperature. x KT x    constant (k) Linear Expansion L T L    Coefficient of Linear expansion (  ) :  L Increase in length per unit length per degree rise in temp.

Principle of calorimetry states that, neglecting heat loss to surroundings, heat lost by a body at higher temperature is equal heat gained by a body at lower temperature. heat gained = heat lost Whenever heat is given to any body, either its temperature changes or its state changes. 1.4.1 Change in Temperature When the temp changes on heating, Then Heat supplied  change in temp (  T)  amount of substance (m/n)  nature of substance (s/C)   H = ms  T m = Mass of body s = specific heat capacity per kg  T = Change in temp or  H = nC  T n = Number of moles C = Specific/Molar heat Capacity per mole  T = Change in temp • Specific Heat Capacity : Amount of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of the substance through one degree.

Units SI  J/Kg Common  Cal/g • The change in state always occurs at a constant temperature. For example f Solid Liq L  v Liq Gas L  L f = Latent Heat of fusion L v = Latent heat of vaporization • In case any material is not at its B.P or M.P, then on heating the temperature will change till the time a particular state change temperature reaches. For Example : If water is initially at –50°C at 1 Atm pressure in its solid state. On heating. Step - 1 : Temp changes to 0°C first Step - 2 : Ice melts to H 2 O( l ) keeping the temp constant Step - 3 : Temp. inverses to 100°C Step - 4 : H 2 O( l ) boils to steam keeping the temp constant Step - 5 : Further temp increases Temp Heat • The slope is inversely proportional to heat capacity. • Length of horizontal line depends upon mL for the process. 1.4.3 Pressure dependence on melting point and boiling point • For some substance melting point decreases with increases pressure and for other melting point increases • Melting poing increases with increase in temperature. We can observe the above results through phaser diagrams. P (atm) B C Liq O Solid Vapour A T(°C) For H O 2 P (atm) B C Liq O Solid Vapour A T(°C) For CO 2 Line AO  Sublimation curve Line OB  Fusion curve Line OC  Vapourization curve Point O  Triple Point Point C  Critical temperature Triple Point : The combination pressure and temperature at which all three states of matter (i.e. solids, liquids gases co-exist. For H 2 O it is at 273.16K and 0.006 Atm. Critical Point : The combination of pressure & temp beyond which a vapour cannot be liquified is called as critical point. Corresponding temperature, pressure are called as critical temperature & critical pressure. ","HEAT & THERMODYNAMICS • From the phasor diagram, we can see that melting point decreases with increases in pressure for H 2 O. Based on this is the concept of reglation. Reglation : The phenomena of refreezing of water melted below the normal melting point due to addition of pressure. • It is due to this pressure effect on melting point that cooking is tough on mountains and lasier in pressure cooker. 1.5 Heat Transfer There are three modes of heat transfer. • Conduction • Convection • Radiation 1.5.1 Conduction Thermal conduction is the process in which thermal energy is transferred from the hotter part of a body to the colder one or from hot body to a cold body in contact with it without any transference of material particles. T > T C D T D T C L A Direction of heat flow At steady state, The rate of heat energy flowing through the rod becomes constant. This is rate   C D T T Q kA L   ...(i) for uniform cross-section rods where Q = Rate of heat energy flow (J/s or W) A = Area of cross-section (m 2 ) T C T D = Temperature of hot end and cold end respectively (°C or K) L = Length of the rod (m) K = coefficient of thermal conductivity Coefficient of Thermal Conductivity : It is defined as amount of heat conducted during steady state in unit time through unit area of any cross-section of the substance under unit temperature gradient, the heat flow being normal to the area. Units SI  J/mSk or W/mK. • Larger the thermal conductivity, the greater will be rate of heat energy flow for a given temperature difference. • K metals > K non metals • Thermal conductivity of insulators is very low. Therefore, air does not let the heat energy to be conducted very easily. • For combinations of rods between two ends kept at different temperatures, we can use the concept of equivalent thermal conductivity of the composite rod. For example :  T 1 T 2 L , K , A 1 1 L , K , A 2 2 T 1 T 2 L , 2L, A eq where K eq for equivalent thermal conductivity of the compositive. • The term   C D T T L  in the above equation is called as Temperature Gradient. Temperature Gradient : The fall in temperature per unit length in the direction of flow of heat energy is called as Temperature Gradient Units SI  K/m • The term Q, (i.e.) rate of flow of heat energy can also be named as heat current • The term (L/KA) is called as thermal resistance of any conducting rod. Thermal Resistance : Obstruction offered to the flow of heat current by the medium Units  K/W 1.5.2 Convection The process in which heat is transferred from one point to another by the actual movement of the heated material particles from a place at higher temperature to another place of lower temperature is called as thermal convection. • If the medium is forced to move with the help of a fan or a pump, it is called as forced convection. If the material moves because of the differences in density of the medium, the process is called natural or free convection. • Examples of forced convection Circulatory system, cooling system of an automobile heat connector ","HEAT & THERMODYNAMICS • Examples of natural convection Trade winds, Sea Breeze/Land Breeze, Monsoons Burning of Tea. 1.5.3 Radiation It is a process of transmission of heat in which heat travels directly from one place to another without the agency of any intervening medium. • This radiation of heat energy occurs in the form of EM waves. • These radiators are emitted by virtue of its temperature, like the radiation by a red hot iron or light from a filament lamp. • Every body radiates energy as well as absorbs energy from surroundings. • The proportion of energy absorbed depends upon the colour of the body. (a) Newtons Law of cooling Newton’s Law of cooling states that, the rate of loss of heat d dt  of the body is directly proportional to the differenct of temp difference Now   2 1 ds kT T dt    ...(4) where k is a positive constant depending upon area and nature of the surface of the body. Suppose a body of mass m, specific heat capacity s is at temperature T 2 & T 1 be the temp of surroundings if dT 2 the fall of temperature in time dt. Amount of heat lost is dcs = msdT 2  Rate of loss of heat is given by 2 dT dcs ms dt dt  ...(5) From Equation 4 and 5   2 2 1 dT ms kT T dt     2 2 1 dT k dt Kdt T T ms     where k K ms  On integrating log (T 2 – T 2 ) = –Kt + C or T 2 = T 1 + C 1 e –Kt where C 1 = e c ...(6) equation (6) enables you to calculate the time of cooling of a body through a particular range of temperature.  T (°C) Time (minute) log (T –T ) 2 1 Time • For small temp diff, the rate of cooling, due to conduction, convection & radiation combined is proportional to difference in temperature. • Approximation : If a body cools from T a to T B in t times in medium where surrounding temp is T 0 , then a b a b 0 T T T T K T t 2           • Newton’s Law of cooling can be verified experimentally. T 1 T 2 C V (a) log (T -T e 2 1 ) t (b) Set Up : A double walled vessel (v) containng water in between two walls. A copper calorimeter (c) containing hot water placed inside the double walled vessel. Two thermometers through the carbs are used to not the temperature T 2 of H 2 O in calorimeter T 1 of water in between the double walls respectively. Experiment : The temperature of hot water in the calorimeter after equal intervals of time. Result : A graph is plotted between log (T 2 – T 1 ) and time (t). The nature of the graph is observed to be a straight line as it should be from Newton’s law of cooling. ","HEAT & THERMODYNAMICS 2. THERMODYNAMICS It is the study of interelations between heat and other forms of energy Thermodynamic System : A collection of large number of molecules of matter (solid, liquid or gas) which are so arranged that these posses certain values of pressure, volume and temperature forms a thermodynamic system. • The parameters pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy etc which determine the state or condition of system are called thermodynamic state variables. In thermodynamics we deal with the thermodynamic systems as a whole and study the interaction of heat & energy during the change of one thermodynamic state to another. 2.1 Thermal Equilibrium The term ‘equilibrium’ in thermodynamics implies the state when all the macroscopic variables characterising the system (P, V, T, mass etc) do not change with time. • Two systems when in contact with each other come to thermal equilibrium when their temperatures become same. • Based on this is zeroth law of thermodynamics. According to zeroth law, when the thermodynamics systems A and B are separately in thermal equilibrium with a third thermodynamic system C, then the systems A and B are in thermal equilibrium with each other also. 2.2 Heat, Work and Internal Energy Internal Energy is the energy possessed by any system due to its molecular K.E. and molecular P.E. Here K.E & P.E are with respect to centre of mass frame. This internal energy depends entirely on state and hence it is a state variable. For 1 real gases internal energy is only by virtue of its molecular motion. Units n RT 3 f for ideal gases where n = number of moles f = Degree of fredom R = Universal Gas Constant T = Temperature in Kelvin Internal Energy can be change either by giving heat energy or by performing some work. Heat Energy is the energy transformed to or from the system because of the difference in temperatures by conduction, convection or radiation. The energy that is transferred from one system to another by force moving its point of application in its own direction is called work. dx System F = PA s s Work done by the system F dx   s P Adx   s P dV   Where P s Pressure of system on the piston. This work done by system is positive if the system expands & it is negative if the system contracts. • Work and Heat are path functions whereas internal energy is a state function. • Heat & work are two different terms through they might look same. 2.3 Important Thermodynamics Terms State Variables : P, V, T, moles They can be extensive or intestive. Equation of State : The equation which connects the pressure (P), the volume (V) and absolute temperature (T) of a gas is called the equation of state. PV = constant (Boyle’s Law) V T = constant (Charle’s Law)  PV = NRT Thermodynamic Process : A thermodynamic process is said to take place when some changes occur in the state of a thermodynamic system, i.e., the thermodynamic parameters of the system change with some important time. Types of these thermodynamic process are Isothermal, Adiabatic, Isobaric and Isocboric Quasi Static Process : A thermodynamic process which is infinitely slow is called as quasi-static process. • In quasi static process, system undergoes change so slowly, that at every instant, system is in equilibrium, both thermal and mechanical, with the surroundings. ","HEAT & THERMODYNAMICS • Quasi-static process is an idealised processed. We generally assume all the processes to be quasistatic unless stated. Indicator P-V, Diagram : A graph between pressure and volume of a gas under thermodynamic operation is called P-V. diagram. P a b c d v a  Isobaric b  Isothermal c  Adiabatic d  Isochoric • Area under P – V diagram gives us work done by a gas. 2.4 1 st Law of Thermodynamics Let  Q = Heat supplied to the system by the surroundings  W = Work done by the system on the surroundings  U = Change in internal energy of the system. First law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. It can be only transformed from the form to another. Mathematically :  Q =  U +  Q Sign Conventions : • When heat is supplied to the system, then  Q is positive and when heat is withdrawn from the system,  Q is negative. • When a gas expands, work done by the gas is positive & when a gas contracts then w is negative •  U is positive, when temperature rises and  U is negative, when temperature falls. Remember here we always take work done by the system. In chemistry, work done on the system is considered. Hence there is some different look of 1 st law of Thermodynamics in chemistry.  Q +  W =  U where  Q,  U have same meanings but W stands for work done on the system 2.5 Application of the First of Law of Thermodynamics Here we see how 1 st Law of Thermodynamics is applied to various thermodynamic processes. 2.5.1 Isothermal Process Description : A thermodynamic process in which temperature remains constant Condition : The walls of the container must be perfectly conducting to allow free exchange of heat between gas and its surroundings. The process of compression or expansion should be slow so as the provide time for exchange of heat. These both conditions are perfectly ideal.

Key Elements : • A source of heat at higher temperature • A working substance • A sink of heat at lower temperature. Working : • The working substance goes through a cycle consisting of several processes. • In some processes it absorbs a total amount of heat Q 1 from the source at temperature T 1 . • In some processes it rejects a total amount of heat Q 2 to the sink at some lower temperature T 2 . • The work done by the system is a cycle is transferred to the environment via some arrangement.

Though all the statements are the same in their contents, the following two are significant. Kelvin Pnek Statement : No process is possible whose sole result is the absorption of heat from a reservoir and the complete conversion of the heat into work. Calcius Statement : No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder object to a hotter object. Significance : 100% officiency in heat engines or infinite CoP in refrigerators is not possible. 2.10 Reversible and Irreversible Process Reversible Process : A thermodynamic process taking a system from initial state i to final state f is reversible, if the process can be turned back such that both, the system and the surroundings return to their original states, with no other change anywhere else in the universe. Conditions for reversibility : 1. Process should proceed at an extremely slow rate, i.e., process is quasistatic so that system is in equilibrium with surroundings at every stage. 2. The system should be free from dissipative forces like friction, inelasticity; viscosity etc. Examples : No process exactly reversible, though a slow expansion of an ideal gas is approximately reversible. Irreversible Process : A process which does not satisfy any of the conditions for reversible is called an irreversible process. Causes : • Spontaneous process • Presence of friction, viscosity and such dissi-ptive forces Significance of Reversibility : • Main concern of thermodynamics is the efficiency with which the heat is converted into Mechanical Energy. • Second Law of Thermodynamics rules out the possibility of a perfect heat engine with 100% efficiency. • It turns out that heat engine based on idealised reversible processes achieves the highest possible efficiency. 2.11 Carnot Engine Sadi Carnot devised on ideal cycle of operation for a heat engine called as carnot cycle. Engine used for realising this ideal cycle is called as carnot heat engine. Constructions : The essential parts of an ideal heat engine or Carnot heat engine are shown in figure. ","HEAT & THERMODYNAMICS Source at Temp. T 1 Insulating Pad Sink at Temp. T 2 Ideal Gas Cylinder (i) Source of heat : The source is maintained at a fixed higher temperature T 1 , from which the working substance draws heat. The source is supposed to possess infinite thermal capacity and as such any another of heat can be drawn from it without changing its temperature. (ii) Sink of heat : The sink is maintained at a fixed lower temperature T 2 , to which any amount of heat can be rejected by the working substance. It has also infinite thermal capacity and as such its temperature remains constant at T 2 , even when any amount of heat is rejected to it. (iii) Working substance : A perfect gas acts as the working substance. It is contained in a cylinder with non-conducting sides but having a perfectly conducting-base. This cylinder is fitted with perfectly non-conducting and frictionless piston. Apart from these essential parts, there is a perfectly insulating stand or pad on which the cylinder can be placed. It would isolate the working substance completely from the surroundings. Hence, the gas can undergo adiabatic changes. The Carnot cycle consists of the following four stages : 1. Isothermal exdpansion 2. Adiabatic expansion 3. Isothermal compression 4. Adiabatic compression. The cycle is carried out with the help of the Carnot engine as detailed below : A(V , P ) 1 1 B(V , P ) 2 2 C(V , P ) 3 3 Pressure (P) X K L M N P O Q 1 D(V , P ) 4 4 Q 2 T 1 T 2 Volume (V) Consider one gram mole of an ideal gas enclosed in the cylinder. Let V 1 , P 1 , T 1 be the initial volume, pressure and temperature of the gas. The initial state of the gas is represented by the point Aon P–V. diagram, We shall assume that all the four processes are quasi-static and non dissipative, the two conditions for their reversibility. Steps 1. Isothermal Expansion : The cylinder is placed on the source and gas is allowed to expand by slow outward motion of piston. Since base is perfectly conducting therefore the process is isothermal. Now  U 1 = O q 1 = W 1 = 2 1 1 V RT n. V l = Area ABmKA q 1  Heat absorbed by gas w 1  work done by gas 2. Adiabatic Expansion : The cylinder is now removed from source and is placed on the perfectly insulating pad. The gas is allowed to expand further from B(P 2 , V 2 ) to C (P 3 , V 3 ). Since the gas is thermally insulated from all sides, therefore the processes is adiabatic q 2 = 0   2 1 2 RT T U r 1       3 1 2 RT T W r 1    = Area BCNMB 3.

(b) The efficiency of the Carnot engine is independent of the nature of the working substance. Engine used for realising this ideal cycle is called as carnot heat engine. Proof : Step - 1 : Imagine a reversible engine R and an irreversible engine-I working between the same source (hot reservoir T 1 ) and sink (cold reservoir T 2 ). Step - 2 : Couple two engines such that I acts like heat engine and R acts like refrigerator. Step - 3 : Let engine I absorb Q 1 heat from the source deliver work W 1 and release the balance Q 1 – W 1 to the sink in one cycle. T 1 T 2 Q 1 Q –W 1 1 Q –W 1 Q 1 1 R W 1 Step - 4 : Arrange R, such that it returns same heat Q, to the source, taking Q 2 from the sink and requiring work W = Q 1 – Q 2 to be done on it. Step - 5 : Supppose  R <  I (i.e.) If R were to act as an engine it would give less work output than that of I (i.e.) W < W 1 for a given Q 1 and Q 1 – W > Q 1 – W 1 ","HEAT & THERMODYNAMICS Step - 6 : In totality, the I-R system extracts heat (r 1 – W) – (Q 1 – W 1 ) = W 1 – W & delivers same amount of work in one cycle, without any change in source or anywhere else. This is against second Law of Thermodynamics. (Kelvin - Planck statement of second law of thermodynamics) Hence the assertion q 1 > q R is wrong. • Similar argument can be put up for the second statement of carnot theorem, (ie) Carnot efficiency is independent of working substance.  We use ideal gas to else are calculating but the relation. 1 1 2 2 Q T Q T  will always hold true for any working substance used in a carnot engine. 3. KINETIC THEORY OF GASES In this topic, we discuss the behaviour of gases and how are the various state variable like P, V, T, moles, U are inter-related with each other 3.1 Molecular Nature of Matter Same as Atomic Theory given by Delton. According to him, atoms are the smallest constituents of elements. All atoms of one element are identical, but atoms of different element are different. In solids : Atoms tightly packed, interatomic spacing about Å . Interatomic force of attraction are strong. In liquids : Atoms are not as rigidly fixed as in solids. Interatomic spacing is about the same 2Å. Interatomic for a attraction are relative weaker. In Gases : Atoms very free. Inter atomic spacing is about tens of Angstroms. Interatomic forces are much weaker in gases than both in solids and liquids. In this chapter, we mainly focus on gases. 3.2 Molecular Nature of Matter 3.2.1 Ideal Gas That gas which strictly obeys the gas laws, (such as Boyle’s Law, Charles, Gay Lussac’s Law etc.) Characteristics • The size of the molecule of an ideal gas is zero. • There is no force of attraction or repulsion amongst the molecules of an ideal gas. 3.2.2 Real Gas All gases are referred to as real Gases. All real gas near the ideal gas behaviour at low pressures and temperatures high enough, where they cannot be liquified. 3.2.3 Ideal Gas Laws Avogadro Hypothesis : Equal volumes of all gas under identical conditions of pressure and temperature would contain equal number of molecule. Perfect Gas Equation : PV = nRT and SRT P M  where n = Number of moles. r = Universal Gas constant = N x k B where N D = Avagadro No. k B = Boltzman constant R = 8031 J/mol K. R = 1.98 Cal/mol K. Boyle’s Law : When temperature of a given mass of gas is kept constant, its pressure varies inversely as the volume of gas. (i.e.) PV = constant Charles Law : When pressure of a given mass of kept constant, volume of the gas varies directly as the temperature of the gas. (i.e.) V  T Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures : The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is the sum of partial pressures exerted by the individual gases in the mixture.

A gas consists of a very large number of molecules (of the other of Avogadro’s number. 10 23 ), which are perfect elastic spheres. For a given gas they are identical in all respects, but for different gases, they are different. 2. The molecules of a gas are in a state of incessant random motion. They move in all directions with different speeds., ( of the order of 500 m/s) and obey Newton’s laws of motion. 3. The size of the gas molecules is very small as compred to the distance between them. If typical size of molecule is 2 Å, average distance between the molecules is  20 Å. Hence volume occupied by the molecules is negligible in comparison to the volume of the gas. 4. The molecules do not exert any fore of attraction or repulsion on each other, except during collision. 5. The collisions of the molecules with themselves and with the walls of the vessel are perfectly elastic. As such, that momentum and the kinetic energy of the molecules are conserved during collisions, though their individual velocities change. 6. There is not concentration of the molecules at any point inside the container i.e. molecular density is uniform throughout the gas. 7. A molecule moves along a straight line between two successive collisions and the average straight distance covered between two successive collisions is called the mean free path of the molecules. 8. The collisions are almost instantaneous, i.e., the time of collision of two molecules is negligible as compared to time interval between two successive collisions. 3.4 Pressure of an Ideal Gas and its Expression Pressure exerted by the gas is due to continuous bombardment of gas molecules against the walls of the container. Expression : Consider a gas enclosed in a cube of side 1. Take the axes to be parallel to the sides of the cube, as shown in figure. A molecule with velocity (  x ,  y ,  z ) hits the planar wall parallel to yz-plane of area A (= l 2 ). Since the collision is elastic, the molecule rebounds with the same velocity; its y and z components of velocity do not change in the collision but the x-component reverses sig. That is, the velocity after collision is (–  x ,v z , v y ). The change in momentum of the molecule is : –m  x – (m  x ) – 2m  x . By the principle of conservation of momentum, the momentum imparted to the wall in the collision = 2m  x . To calculate the force (and pressure) on the wall, we need to calculate momentum imparted to the wall per unit time, if it is within the distance  x  t from the wall. that is, all molecules within the volume, A  x  t only can hit the wall in time  T is 1/2A  x  t n where n is the number of molecules per unit volume. The total momentum transferred to the wall by these molecules in time  t is : Q = (2m  x ) (1/2 n Av x  t) The force on the wall is the rate of momentum transfer Q/  t and pressure is force per unit area : P = Q/(A  t) = nm  x 2 ","HEAT & THERMODYNAMICS Actually, all molecules in a gas do not have the same velocity; there is a distribution in velocities. The above equation therefore, stands for pressure due to the group of molecules with speed  x in the x-direction and n stands for the number density of that group of molecules. The total pressure is obtained by summing over the contribution due to all groups: 2 x P nm   where 2 x  is the average of 2 x  . Now the gas is isotropic, i.e. there is no preferred direction of velocity of the molecules in the vessel.

All the ideal gas laws can be derived from Kinetic Theory of gases. 3.6 Derivation of Gas Laws from Kinetic Theory 3.6.1 Boyle’s Law We know that 2 PV NK 3  where K is the average kinetic energy of translation per gas molecule. At constant temperature. K is constant and for a given mass of the gas. N is constant. Thus, PV = constant for given mass of gas at constant temperature, which is the Boyle’s Law. 3.6.2 Charle’s Law We know that 2 PV NK 3  For a given mass of gas, N is constant. ","HEAT & THERMODYNAMICS Since B 3 K k T, K T 2   and as such PV  T. If P is constant, V  T, which is the Charles’ Law. 3.6.3 Constant Volume Law We know that 2 PV NK 3  For a given mass of gas, N is constant. Since B 3 K k T, K T 2   Thus, PV  T If V is constant, P  T, which the constant volume law. 3.6.4 Ideal Gas Equation As 2 PV NK 3  and B 3 K kT 2  B 2 3 PV N kT 3 2        or PV = Nk B T which is the ideal gas equation. 3.6.5 Avogadro’s Law Consider two gases 1 and 2. We can write 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 PV N K , PV NK 3 3   If their pressures, volumes and temperatures are the same, then P 1 = P 2 , V 1 = V 2 , 1 2 K K  . Clearly, N 1 = N 2 Thus : Equal volumes of all ideal gases existing under the same conditions of temperature and pressure contain equal number of molecules which is Avogadro’s Law or hypothesis. This law is named after the Italian physicist and chemist, Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856). Alliter : As B B PV PV Nk T, N kT   If P, V and T are constants, N is also constant. 3.6.6 Graham’s Law of Diffusion The rate (r) of diffusion of a gas through a porous pot or into another gas is determined by the rms speed of its molecules, i.e., r  rms But as rms 3P 3P 1 ,r or r        Therefore, if r 1 and r 2 are the rates of diffusion of two gases of densities  1 and  2 respectively, 1 2 2 1 r r    The rates of diffusion of two gases are thus inversely proprotional to the square roots of their densities which is Graham’s Law of diffusion. 3.6.7 Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures The kinetic theory of gases attributes the gas pressure to the bombardment of the walls of the containing vessel by molecules. In a mixture of ideal gases, we might therefore expect the total pressure (P) to be the sum of the partial pressures (p 1 , p 2 , ...) due to each gas, i.e., 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 N N 2 2 P p p ...

This is due to the reason that though the equation in box IV is useful, it does not tell us anything new, since it results from combining equations in boxes II and III. 3.7 Internal Energy As studied in thermodynamics, Internal Energy of any substance is the combination of Potential Energies & Kinetic Energies of all molecules inside a given gas. • In real gas Internal Energy = P.E of molecules + K.E of Molecules • In real gas Internal Energy = K.E of Molecules Here PE of molecules is zero as assumed in Kinetic theory postulates; There is no interaction between the molecules hence its interactional energy is zero. 3.8 Degree of Freedom The number of degrees of freedom of a dynamical system is defined as the total number of coo-ordinates or independent quantities required to describe completely the position & configuration of the system. Example : • A particle moving in straight line, say along X-axis need only x coordinate to define itself. It has only degree of freedom. • A particle in a plane, needs 2 co-ordinates, hence has 2 degree of freedom.

Apart from them if there v vibrational modes then there will be additional 2v vibrational degrees of freedom.  Total degree of freedom n = 3 + 3 + 2V = 6 + 2V 3.9 Law of Equipartition of Energy Statement : According to this law, for any dynamical system in thrmal equilibrium, the total energy is distributed equally amongst all the degrees of freedom, and the energy associated with each molecule per degree of freedom is B 1 kT 2 , where k B is Boltzman constant and T is temperature of the system. Application : B kT U 2  f where = Total degree of freedom. This law is very helpful in determining the total internal energy of any system be it monoatomic, diatomic or any polyatomic. Once the internal energy is know we can very easy predict C v & C P for such systems.

Focus on a single molecule with the average speed <v>. It will suffer collision with any molecule that comes within a distance d between the centres. In time  t, it sweeps a volume  d 2 <v>  t wherein any other molecule will collide with it (as shown in figure). If n is the number of molecules per unit volume, the molecule suffers n  d 2 <v>  t collisions in time  t. thus the rate of collisions is n  d 2 <v> or the time between two successive collisions is on the average.  = 1/(n  <v> d 2 ) The average distance between two successive collisions, called the mean free path 1, is : l = <v>  = 1/(n  d 2 ) In this derivation, we imagined the other molecules to be at rest. But actually all molecules are moving and the collision rate is determined by the average relative velocity of the molecules. Thus we need to replace <v> by <vr> in equation.

HEAT & THERMODYNAMICS ","Introduction What is Kinetic Theory? • Kinetic theory explains the behaviour of gases based on the idea that the gas consists of rapidly moving atoms or molecules. • In solids the molecules are very tightly packed as inter molecular space is not present In liquids inter molecular spaces are more as compared to solids and in gases the molecules are very loosely packed as intermolecular spaces are very large. • The random movement of molecules in a gas is explained by kinetic theory of gases. • We will also see that why kinetic theory is accepted as a success theory. • Kinetic theory explains the following:-a) Molecular interpretation of pressure and temperature can be explained. b) It is consistent with gas laws and Avogadro’s hypothesis. c) Correctly explains specific heat capacities of many gases. 13.2 Molecular nature of matter • Atomic hypothesis was given by many scientists. According to which everything in this universe is made up of atoms. • Atoms are little particles that move around in a perpetual order attracting each other when they are little distance apart. But if they are forced very close to each other then they repel. • Dalton’s atomic theory is also referred as the molecular theory of matter. This theory proves that matter is made up of molecules which in turn are made up of atoms. • According to Gay Lussac’s law when gases combine chemically to yield another gas, their volumes are in ratios of small integers. • Avogadro’s law states that the equal volumes of all gases at equal temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules. • Conclusion: - All these laws proved the molecular nature of gases. • Dalton’s molecular theory forms the basis of Kinetic theory. Why was Dalton’s theory a success? • Matter is made up of molecules, which in turn are made up of atoms. • Atomic structure can be viewed by an electron microscope. Solids, Liquids, Gases in terms of molecular structure Basis of difference Solids Liquids Gases Inter Atomic Distance(distance between molecules). Molecules are very tightly packed. Inter atomic distance is minimum. Molecules are not so tightly packed. Inter atomic distance is more as compared to solids. Molecules are loosely packed .Free to move. Inter atomic distance is maximum. Mean Free Path is the average distance a molecule can travel without colliding. No mean free path. Less mean free path. There is mean free path followed by the molecules. Chapter 13 Kinetic Theory 1 ","13.3 Behaviour of Gases o Gases at low pressures and high temperatures much above that at which they liquify (or solidify) approximately satisfy a relation between their pressure, temperature and volume: PV=KT … … … (i) This is the universal relation which is satisfied by all gases. where P, V, T are pressure, volume and temperature respectively, and K is the constant for a given volume of gas. It varies with volume of gas. K=Nk B where, N=number of molecules and k B = Boltzmann Constant and its value never change. o From equation (i) PV= Nk B Therefore PV/NT = constant=(k B ) (Same for all gases). o Consider there are 2 gases :- (P 1 ,V 1 ,T 1 ) and (P 2 , V 2 ,T 2 ) where P, V and T are pressure, volume and temperature resp. o Therefore P 1 ,V 1 /(N 1 T 1 ) = P 2 V 2 /(N 2 T 2 ) o Conclusion: - This relation is satisfied by all gases at low pressure and high temperature. Justification of the Avogadro’s hypothesis from equation of gas o Avogadro’s hypothesis states that equal volumes of all gases at equal temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules. o Consider the equation PV/NT = constant and if P,V and T are same for 2 gases then N(number of molecules) is also same. o According to Avogadro’s hypothesis number of molecules per unit volume is same for all gases at a fixed P and T. Avogadro number is denoted by N A . Where, N A = 6.02x10 23 . It is universal value. o Experimentally it has been found that the mass of 24.4 litres of any gas is equal to molecular weight in grams at standard temperature and pressure. Perfect Gas Equation o Perfect gas equation is given by 𝑃𝑉 = 𝜇𝑅𝑇 , Where P,V are pressure, volume, T =absolute temperature, μ = number of mole s and R =universal gas constant, R= k B N A where, k B = Boltzmann constant and N A = Avogadro’s Number o This equation tells about the behaviour of gas at a particular situation. o If a gas satisfies this equation then the gas is known as Perfect gas or an ideal gas. Different Forms of Perfect Gas Equation 1. PV=μRT … … … (i) Where μ (no. of moles) = N/N A where N=no of molecules and N A = Avogadro number(no of molecules in 1 mole of gas).Orμ = M/M o where M=mass of sample of gas and M o = molar mass. PV = (N/N A )RT (putting μ=N/N A in equation(i)) By simplifying PV = Nk B T PV=Nk B T => P = (N/V) k B T => P=nk B T Where, n(number density) =N/V. where, N=number of molecules and V=volume. 2 ","∴ PV=nk B T 2. Substitute μ = M/M o in equation(i) PV=(M/M o ) RT => P=(M/V)1/M o RT where M/V = ρ (mass density of the gas) ∴ P=ρRT/M o Ideal Gas o A gas that satisfies the perfect gas equation exactly at all pressures and temperatures. o Ideal gas is a theoretical concept. o No real gas is truly ideal. A gas which is ideal is known as real gas. o Real gases approach the ideal gas behaviour for low pressures and high temperatures. Real gases deviation from ideal gas o Real gases approach the ideal gas behaviour for low pressures and high temperatures. o Ideal gas equation PV=μRT, for 1 mole ,μ=1,PV=RT =>PV/RT=constant Graph should be a straight line(parallel to x-axis) for ideal gas. This means it has constant value at all temperature and all pressure. o But in case of real gases graph approach ideal gas behaviour at high temperature and low pressure. o At high temperature and low pressure molecules are far apart. When temperature is increased the molecules will move randomly far from each other. o As a result molecular interaction decreases the gas behaves as an ideal gas. o The ideal behaviour comes into picture when the molecular present inside the gas don’t interact with each other. Deduction of Boyle’s law and Charles law from perfect gas equation 1. Boyle’s law: -Deriv ing Boyle’s law from perfect gas equation, PV=μRT o Consider T (temperature) and μ (no. of moles) constant. o Therefore PV=constant . o According to Boyle’s law, at a constant temperature, pressure of a given mass of gas varies inversely with volume. 3 ","2. Charles’s law:-Consider If P(Pressure) is constant, then o From Perfect gas equation PV =μRT,=> V/T=μR/P =constant o Therefore V/T = constant. o According to Charles’s law for a fixed pressure, volume of a gas is ∝ to its absolute temperature. o Conclusion: - Ideal gas sati sfies the Boyle’s law and Charles’s law. Deducing Dalton’s Law of partial pressures o Dalton’s law of partial pressure states that the total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is the sum of partial pressures. o Consider if there are several ideal gases mixed together in a vessel, then the total pressure of that vessel is equal to sum of partial pressure. o Partial pressure is the pressure exerted by a particular gas if only that gas is present in the vessel. o For example: - Consider if in a vessel there is a mixture of 3 gases, A,B and C.So the partial pressure of A is equal to pressure exerted only by Aand considering B and C are not present. Similarly partial pressure of B is equal to the pressure exerted only by B and considering A and C are not there. Similarly for C. According to Dalton’s law the total pressure of mixture is sum of partial pressure of A, partial pressure of B and partial pressure of C. To show how perfect gas equation concludes Dalton’s law of partial pressure:-o Suppose there is a mixture of ideal gases which means these gases do not interact with each other. By perfect gas equation, PV=μRT Where V=volume of vessel,P=Pressure and T=temperature andμ (no. of moles). As there are mixture of gases therefore μ=μ 1 + μ 2 + … so on. PV=( μ 1 + μ 2 + … )RT 4 ","P = ( μ 1 +μ 2 +… )RT/V =>P = μ 1 RT/V + μ 2 RT/V + … ∴ P=P 1 +P 2 + … Where P 1 =partial pressure of gas 1 and P 2 =partial pressure of gas 2. ∴ P= P 1 +P 2 +---total pressure due to the mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressure of the gas. 13.4 Kinetic Theory of an Ideal Gas Basis of Kinetic Theory: - 1. Molecules of gas are in incessant random motion, colliding against one another and with the walls of the container. 2. All collisions are elastic. 3. Total Kinetic energy is conserved. 4. Total momentum is conserved. 5. In case of an elastic collision total Kinetic energy and momentum before collision is equal to the total Kinetic energy and momentum after collision. What does Kinetic Theory tells? 1. At ordinary temperature and pressure the molecular size is very small as compared to inter molecular distance between them. 2. In case of gas, molecules are very far from each other and the size of molecules is small as compared to the distance between them. 3. As a result, interaction between them is negligible. As there is no interaction between the molecules, there will be no force between the molecules. 4. As a result molecules are moving freely as per newton’s first law of motion. 5. The molecules should move along straight line but when they come closer they experience the intermolecular forces and as a result their velocities change. 6. This phenomenon is known as collision. These collisions are elastic. 5 ","13.4.1 Pressure of an ideal gas based on Kinetic theory Assumptions :- o Consider a cube shape container filled with an ideal gas. We will consider only one molecule; the molecule hits the walls of the container and bounces back. o Let the velocity of the molecule when it is moving be (𝑣 ? ,𝑣 ? ,𝑣 ? ). o When the molecule bounces back, the velocity will be (−𝑣 ? ,𝑣 ? ,𝑣 ? ). o Change in momentum = P f −P i where P f = final momentum and P i = initial momentum) o 𝑃 𝑓 −𝑃 𝑖 = −?𝑣 ? − ?𝑣 ? = −2?𝑣 ? o This change in momentum is imparted to the wall due to the collision. o Momentum imparted to the wall in collision by one molecule = 2?𝑣 ? • But there are as many molecules, we have to calculate total momentum imparted to the wall by all of them. • To calculate the number of molecules that hit the wall: Area of wall= A ∴ in time ∆𝑡 , all molecules within a distance of 𝐴𝑣 ? ∆𝑡 can hit the wall. but on an average half of molecules move towards the wall and half away from the wall. ∴ ( 1 2 ) 𝐴𝑣 ? ∆𝑡 will hit the wall. o ∴ total momentum imparted to the wall = 2?𝑣 ? × 1 2 ? 𝐴𝑣 ? ∆𝑡 = 𝐴?𝑣 ? 2 ∆𝑡? o Force exerted on the wall= rate of change of momentum= 𝐴?𝑣 ? 2 ? o Pressure on the wall 𝑃= ? ? = ??𝑣 ? 2 o ∴ 𝑃 = ??𝑣 ? 2 is true for group of molecules moving with velocity 𝑣 ? Note: i. All the molecules inside the gas will not have the same value of velocity. All will have different velocities ii. The above equation therefore, is valid for pressure due to the group of molecules with speed 𝑣 ? in the x-direction and n stands for the number density of that group of molecules. • Therefore total pressure due to all such groups will be obtained by summing over the contribution due to the molecule 𝑃 = ??𝑣 ? 2 ̅̅̅ • Where, 𝑣 ? 2 ̅̅̅ is the average of 𝑣 ? 2 . o Since the gas is isotropic the molecules move randomly which means the velocity of all the molecules can be in any direction. Therefore 𝑣 ? 2 ̅̅̅ =𝑣 ? 2 ̅̅̅ =𝑣 ? 2 ̅̅̅ = 1 3 (𝑣 ? 2 ̅̅̅ =𝑣 ? 2 ̅̅̅ =𝑣 ? 2 ̅̅̅ )= 1 3 𝑣 2 o Therefore, Pressure, 𝑃= 1 3 ??𝑣 2 , where 𝑣 2 = average squared speed. 6 ","Justifying the assumptions:-• We have assumed the container containing the gas is a cube. The shape of the container is immaterial. • For a vessel of any arbitrary shape, we can choose a small infinitesimal (planar) area and can prove the above derivation. • We will see A and Δt are not there in the final result. • By Pascal’s law pressure in one portion of gas in equilibrium is the same as anywhere else. • All collisions are neglected. a) The number of molecules hitting the wall in time Δt was found to be ( 1 2 ) 𝐴𝑣 ? ∆𝑡 , with random collisions and a steady state of gas. b) Thus, if a molecule with velocity (v x , v y , v z ) acquires a different velocity due to collision with some molecules, there will always be some other molecule with a different initial velocity which after a collision acquires the velocity (v x , v y , v z ). c) Molecular collision, when they are not too frequent and the time spent in collision is very small compared to the time between collisions, will not have any affect in the above calculation. 13.4.2 Kinetic Interpretation of Temperature • The average kinetic energy of a molecule is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. • It is independent of pressure, volume or nature of the ideal gas. • Multiplying with V on both sides, 𝑃𝑉 = 1 3 ?𝑉?𝑣 2 ̅̅̅ After simplifying, 𝑃𝑉 = 2 3 𝑁× 1 2 ?𝑣 2 ̅̅̅ , where, ? = 𝑁/𝑉 𝑁 - Number of molecules in a sample. • Therefore 𝑃𝑉 = 2 3 𝐸……….(𝑖) 𝐸 - Kinetic energy =𝑁× 1 2 ?𝑣 2 ̅̅̅ This is the basis of Kinetic interpretation of temperature. • Combining eq(i) with the ideal gas equation, we get 𝐸= 3 2 𝑘 ? 𝑁𝑇 … … … … … (𝑖𝑖) ?𝑟, 𝐸 𝑁 = 1 2 ?𝑣 2 ̅̅̅ = 3 2 𝑘 ? 𝑇 … … … … … (𝑖𝑖𝑖) This is the average kinetic energy ∴ 𝐾𝐸 ∝ 𝑇 Hence, temperature can be interpreted as a molecular quantity. 7 ","Kinetic theory: Consistent with ideal gas equation and gas laws 1. Consistent with ideal gas equation: From kinetic interpretation ? 𝑁 = 3 2 𝑘 ? 𝑇 => 𝐸 = 3 2 𝑁𝑘 ? 𝑇 The internal energy of an ideal gas is directly proportional to T This shows that internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature, not on pressure or volume. 2. Consistent with Dalton’s law of partial pressures: 𝑃= 1 3 ??𝑣 2 , from kinetic theory ∴ if a vessel contains a mixture of gases, 𝑃= 1 3 [? 1 ? 1 𝑣 1 2 ̅̅̅ +? 2 ? 2 𝑣 2 2 ̅̅̅ +⋯] in equillibrium average Kinetic energy of molecules of different gasses will be equal 1 2 ? 1 𝑣 1 2 ̅̅̅ = 1 2 ? 2 𝑣 2 2 ̅̅̅ =⋯= 3 2 𝑘 ? 𝑇 Total pressure, 𝑃= 1 3 [ 3 2 ? 1 𝑘 ? 𝑇+ 3 2 ? 2 𝑘 ? 𝑇+⋯] 𝑃 =𝑘 ? 𝑇[? 1 +? 2 +⋯] 𝑃= 𝑅 𝑁 ? [? 1 +? 2 +⋯] 𝑃 = [𝜇 1 +𝜇 2 + ⋯ ]𝑅𝑇 𝑃 =𝑃 1 +𝑃 2 +⋯ This is Datlon’s law of partial pressure. Law of Equipartition of energy:Degrees of Freedom o Degrees of Freedom can be defined as independent displacements or rotations that specify the orientation of a body or system. o A molecule free to move in space needs three coordinates to specify its location. o If it is constrained to move in a plane it needs to. o If constrained to move along a line, it needs just one coordinate to locate it. o For example:-Consider a room and if we tie a thick rope from one wall to another. o Take a ball which is moving straight on the rope. o The ball has only 1 degree of freedom. It can move only in one particular dimension. o Consider if the ball is on the floor which is two-dimensional, then the ball can move along 2 directions. o The ball has 2 degree of freedoms. o Consider if we throw the ball in space which is 3 dimensional. Then the ball can move in 3 dimensions. o Therefore degree of freedom tells us in how many ways a body can move or rotate or vibrate. Categories of Degrees of Freedom 1. Translational degree of freedom. 2. Rotational degree of freedom. 3. Vibrational degree of freedom. Translational degree of freedom:-o Translation means motion of the body as a whole from one point to another. o For example: o Consider the oxygen molecule; it has 2 oxygen atoms which are bonded together. 8 ","o The 2 oxygen atoms along with the bond are considered as whole body. o When the body as a whole is moving from one point to another is known as translational. o Consider a molecule which is free to move in space and so it will need 3 coordinates(x, y, z) to specify its location. o Therefore it has 3 degrees of freedom. o Similarly a molecule which is free to move in a plane which is 2 dimensional and so it needs 2 coordinates to specify its location. o Therefore it has 2 degrees of freedom. o Similarly a molecule which is free to move in line it needs 1 coordinate to specify its location. o Therefore it has 1 degree of freedom. o Molecules of monoatomic gas have only translational degrees of freedom.This means gases which have only one atom. o For example:-Helium atom it consists of only one He atom.It will have translationaldegrees of freedom. o Each translational degree of freedom contributes a term that contains square of some variable of motion. o The variable of motion means the velocity (v x ,v y ,v z ). o The term ( 1/2) mv x 2 will contribute to energy.This is Kinetic energy which is involved with the motion of the molecule from one point to another. In thermal equilibrium, the average of each such term is ( 1/2) k B T . Rotational Degree of freedom o Independent rotations that specify the orientation of a body or system. o There is rotation of one part of the body with respect to the other part. o Rotational degree of freedom happens only in diatomic gas. o Diatomic molecules have rotational degrees of freedom in addition to translational degrees of freedom. o It is possible in diatomic molecules as 2 atoms are connected together by a bond.So the rotation of one atomw.r.t to other atom. o In diatomic there is translational in addition to that they have rotational degree of freedom also. o For example: - Two oxygen atoms joined together by a bond. There are two perpendicular axes. o There are 2 rotations possible along the two axes. o They have 3 translational degrees of freedom and also 2 rotational degree of rotation. o Therefore Rotational degree of freedom contributes a term to the energy that contains square of a rotational variable of motion. o Rotational variable of motion comes from angular momentum ω. o Linear velocity is v x ,v y ,v z . Whereas angular velocity is w x ,w y ,w z . 9 ","o E R (rotational) = (1/2)(I 1 ω 1 )+(1/2)I 2 ω 2 . These are 3 rotationaldegrees of freedom along the 2 perpendicular axes. o The total energy contribution due to the degrees of freedom for oxygen molecule. o There will be 3 translational degree of freedom (1/2)m x v x 2 ,(1/2)m y v y 2 ,(1/2)m z v z 2 ) o 2 rotational degree of freedom (1/2)I 1 2 ω 1 2 ,(1/2)I 2 2 ω 2 2 Vibrational degree of freedom o Some molecules have a mode of vibration,i.e. its atoms oscillate along the inter-atomic axis like a one-dimensional oscillator. o This vibration is observed in some molecules. o For example:- CO atoms oscillate along the interatomic axis like a one-dimensional oscillator. o Consider two 2 atoms they vibrate along the inter-atomic axis. o The vibrational energy terms contain square of vibrational variables of motion. o Total vibrational energy term E v = (1/2) m (dy/dt) 2 + (1/2) ky 2 where (1/2) m(dy/dt) 2 =Kinetic energy and (1/2)ky 2 =Potential energy and k=force constant one-dimensional oscillator. o The vibrational degree of freedom contributes 2 terms.

Each translational degree of freedom contributes (1/2) k B 2. Each rotational degree of freedom contributes (1/2) k B 3.

DAMPED AND FORCED OSCILLATIONS 1. Damped Oscillation : (i) The oscillation of a body whose amplitude goes on decreasing with time is defined as damped oscillation. (ii) In this oscillation the amplitude of oscillation decreases exponentially due to damping forces like frictional force, viscous force etc. +a t –a x O (iii) Due to decrease in amplitude the energy of the oscillator also goes on decreasing exponentially. 2. Forced Oscillation : (i) The oscillation in which a body oscillates under the influence of an external periodic force are known as forced oscillation. (ii) Resonance : When the frequency of external force is equal to the natural frequency of the oscillator, then this state is known as the state of resonance. And this frequency is known as resonant frequency. 4. WAVES (a) Speed of longitudinal wave Speed of longitudinal wave in a medium is given by E v   where, E is the modulus of elasticity,  is the density of the medium. Speed of longitudinal wave in a solid in the form of rod is given by Y v   where, Y is the Young’s modulus of the solid,  is the density of the solid. Speed of longitudinal wave in fluid is given by B v   where, B is the bulk modulus,  is the density of the fluid. (b) Newton’s formula Newton assumed that propagation of sound wave in gas is an isothermal process. Therefore, according to Newton, speed of sound in gas is given by P v   where P is the pressure of the gas and  is the density of the gas. According to the Newton’s formula, the speed of sound in air at S.T.P. is 280 m/s. But the experimental value of t h e s p e e d o f s o u n d i n a i r i s 3 3 2 m s –1 . Newton could not explain this large difference. Newton’s formula was corrected by Laplace. (c) Laplace’s correction Laplace assumed that propagation of sound wave in gas in an adiabatic process. Therefore, according to Laplace, speed of sound in a gas is given by P v    According to Laplace’s correction the speed of sound in air at S.T.P. is 331.3 m/s. This value agrees farily well with the experimental values of the velocity of sound in air at S.T.P. 5. WAVES TRAVELLING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS When two waves of same amplitude and frequency travelling in opposite directions y 1 = A sin (kx –  t) y 2 = A sin (kx +  t) interfere, then a standing wave is produced which is given by, y = y 1 + y 2  y = 2A sin kx cos  t Hence the particle at location x is oscillating in S.H.M. with angular frequency  and amplitude 2A sin kx. As the amplitude depends on location (x), particles are oscillating with different amplitude. ","OSCILLATION AND WAVES Nodes : Amplitude = 0 2A sin kx = 0 x = 0,  /k, 2  /k ....... x = 0,  /2,  , 3  /2, 2  ........ Antinodes : Amplitude is maximum. sin kx = ± 1 x =  /2k, 3  /2k x =  /4, 3  /4, 5  /4 Nodes are completely at rest. Antinodes are oscillating with maximum amplitude (2A). The points between a node and antinode have amplitude between 0 and 2 A. Separation between two consecutive (or antinodes) =  /2. Separation between a node and the next antinode=  /4. Nodes and antinodes are alternately placed. t = 0 t = T/8 t = T/4 t = 3T/8 N 1 t = T/2 N 2 N N t = 3T/8 t = T/4 t = T/8 t = 0 t = T/2 It is clear from the figure that since nodes are, at rest they don’t transfer energy. In a stationary wave, energy is not transferred from one point to the other. 5.1 Vibrations in a stretched string 1. Fixed at both ends.

First overtone or third harmonic. 0 3v 3 4     Only odd harmonics are possible in this case. 5.2 Vibrations in an organ pipe 1. Open Organ pipe (both ends open) The open ends of the tube becomes antinodes because the particles at the open end can oscillate freely. If there are (n + 1) antinodes in all, ","OSCILLATION AND WAVES length of tube, n 2    So, Frequency of oscillations is nv 2   2. Closed organ pipe (One end closed) The open end becomes antinode and closed end become a node. If there are n nodes and n antinodes, L = (2n – 1)  /4 So frequency of oscillations is   2n 1v v 4L     There are only odd harmonics in a tube closed at one end. 5.3 Waves having different frequencies Beats are formed by the superposition of two waves of slightly different frequencies moving in the same direction. The resultant effect heard in this case at any fixed position will consist of alternate loud and weak sounds. Let us consider net effect of two waves of frequencies  1 and  2 and amplitude A at x = 0. 1 1 y A sin 2 t   2 2 y A sin 2 t    y = y 1 + y 2  y = A   1 2 sin 2 t sin 2 t        1 2 1 2 y 2A cos t sin t            Thus the resultant wave can be represented as a travelling wave whose frequency is 1 2 2         and amplitude is 2A cos  (  1 –  2 ) t. As the amplitude term contains t, the amplitude varies periodically with time. For Loud Sounds : Net amplitude = ± 2A  cos  (  1 –  2 ) t = ± 1   (  1 –  2 ) t = 0,  , 2  , 3  .......  1 2 1 2 1 2 t 0, ,      ........ Hence the interval between two loud sounds is given as : 1 2 1     the number of loud sounds per second =  1 –  2  beat per second =  1 –  2 Note that  1 –  2 must be small (0 – 16 Hz) so that sound variations can be distinguished. Filling a tuning form increases its frequency of vibration. Loading a tuning for k decreases its frequency of vibration. 6. DOPPLER EFFECT According to Doppler’s effect, whenever there is a relative motion between a source of sound and listener, the apparent frequency of sound heard by the listener is different from the actual frequency of sound emitted by the source. Apparent frequency, L s v v v v      ","OSCILLATION AND WAVES Sing Convention. All velocities along the direction S to L are taken as positve and all velocities along the direction L to S are taken as negative. When the motion is along some other direction the component of velocity of source and listener along the line joining the source and listener is considered. Special Cases : (a) If the source is moving towards the listener but the listener is at rest, then v s is positive and v L = 0 (figure a). Therefore, s v v v     i.e.  ’ >  (b) If the source is moving away from the listener, but the listener is at rest, then v s is negative and v L = 0 (figure b).

Therefore,   L v v v     i.e.  ’ <  (d) If the source is at rest and listener is moving towards the source, then v s = 0 and v L is negative (figure d). Therefore,   L L v v v v v v       i.e. v ’ >  (e) If the source and listener are approaching each other, then v s is positive and v L is negative (figure e). Therefore,   L L s s v v v v v v v v               i.e.  ’ >  (f) If the source and listener are moving away from each other, then v s is negative and v L is positive, (figure f). Therefore,   L L s s v v v v v v v v         i.e.  ’ <  (g) If the source and listener are both in motion in the same direction and with same velocity, then v s = v L = v ’ (say) (figure g). Therefore,     v v v v        i.e.  ’ =  It means, there is no change in the frequency of sound heard by the listerner.
